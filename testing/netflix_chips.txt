I used to remember when Netflix had really good shows and they weren't limited to Netflix Originals. They also had disney movies and other great movies but now it all feels like the same thing: 15 episodes of the same thing. For example, 13 reasons why (don't roast I know it's garbage) was pretty okay with one season. But the other seasons were totally unnecessary. Stranger things was great but then it kept feeling like the same rehashed plot but with a different monster. And as much as I really love the effects in Sweet Home, it feels like every episode is super dragged out. It's not netflix's fault but it seems to be missing something that made it really cool back in the day and I can't figure out why.
Salt and vinegar are the superior chip. Sour cream & onion chips just have an overly sweet yet salty taste that is just overwhelmingly disgusting. Barbecue chips leave your mouth feeling dry and bitter because of the awful taste. Salt and vinegar are just a perfect combination of flavors that is just overall better than other chips.
