export const fillerText = `So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to
McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of
Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup
various fonts for a type specimen book. It's difficult to find
examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a
dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming
across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples. So
far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the
popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the
filler text has been used for centuries. And anyways, as Cecil Adams
reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were
hiring classics scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems
reasonable to imagine that there was a version in use far before the
age of Letraset. McClintock wrote to Before & After to explain his
discovery; “What I find remarkable is that this text has been the
industry's standard dummy text ever since some printer in the 1500s
took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book;
it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting
but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged
except for an occasional 'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when
the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible
as Greek; the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common
semantic roots!” (The editors published his letter in a correction
headlined “Lorem Oopsum”). As an alternative theory, (and because
Latin scholars do this sort of thing) someone tracked down a 1914
Latin edition of De Finibus which challenges McClintock's 15th century
claims and suggests that the dawn of lorem ipsum was as recent as the
20th century. The 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition ran out of room
on page 34 for the Latin phrase dolorem ipsum (sorrow in itself).
Thus, the truncated phrase leaves one page dangling with “do-”, while
another begins with the now ubiquitous lorem ipsum. Whether a
medieval typesetter chose to garble a well-known (but
non-Biblical—that would have been sacrilegious) text, or whether a
quirk in the 1914 Loeb Edition inspired a graphic designer, it's
admittedly an odd way for Cicero to sail into the 21st century.`;
