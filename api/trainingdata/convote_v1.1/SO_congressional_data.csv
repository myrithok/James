mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the rules package that we have before us today   it is outrageous that my republican colleagues have placed before us a rules package that at best lacks integrity  and at worst is completely unethical   as the highest body of elected officials in our country  we should be held to the highest ethical standards   but instead  my republican colleagues have opted to put before us a rules package that actually lowers our ethics standards  so that they may ,0
mr speaker  i rise for a constitutional point of order   ,0
mr speaker  the resolution we are preparing to consider  the proposed rules for the 109th congress  in my judgment violates the united states constitution which we were just sworn to uphold and defend   it does so by allowing a very limited number of members  potentially only a handful  to constitute the house of representatives   article 1  section 5 of the constitution states that `` each house shall be the judge of the elections  returns and qualifications of its members  and a maj,0

mr speaker  i rise in strong support of this balanced rules package   i want to speak particularly to the provisions regarding homeland security   to determine whether a proposed regime to oversee homeland security is appropriate  one can not just look at a flow chart   the simplest structure is not necessarily the best  nor is one that is unduly complex   one has to look at how a proposed structure will actually function and what it can and can not accomplish   the homeland jurisdictio,1
mr speaker  the chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct is correct when he says that ethics reform must be bipartisan and if the house is to have meaningful bipartisan ethics process  changes of this magnitude can be made  as they were in 1997  only after thoughtful  careful consideration on a bipartisan basis   there has been no effort to look at the rules changes on ethics in a bipartisan manner   in 1997 when i cochaired the committee on ethics reform along with bo,0
mr speaker  we are making a terrible mistake here today by changing the rule in terms of the provision that would simply require no action after a 45day period because  as the earlier speaker immediately preceding me indicated  what we will have done is change a nonpartisan committee that is based on a nonpartisan process into one that provides for a partisan veto over action where the behavior of an individual member or members is at question   that  i suggest and submit  is something t,0

mr speaker  as has been the case for a number of years  the rules package put forward by my republican colleagues continues to trample on the rights of the minority   it will do nothing to stop the abusive practices in this house such as the 3hour vote on the medicare bill in the middle of the night   in fact  it allows the speaker added discretion to reconsider votes that the republican majority loses   in addition  the new rules require an affirmative vote by the ethics committee befo,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i just want to say to the gentlewoman from rochester  new york  ms slaughter   that every single member of this institution  democrat and republican alike  is very concerned and focused on the integrity of this institution  and i believe that that is something which is an extraordinarily high priority for all of us   i believe that the package that we have coming before us is one which addresses many of the concerns that frankly ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   let me say after having heard from two of my committee on rules colleagues that i anxiously look forward to working with them in a bipartisan way to try to proceed with the deliberations in consideration of measures of this house   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i would like to respond to my very good friend from maryland by saying that i may not be as eloquent today as i was when i was in the minority  but i continue to share my very strong commitment to ensure the integrity and the behavior of members of this institution   i also will say as my friend said  it is very clear that the gentleman from colorado  mr hefley    chairman of the committee on standards of official conduct  has ma,1
mr speaker  i will be happy to respond to the gentleman   let me say we are in the midst of a discussion about ethics at this point   obviously  it is our goal to maintain the highest ethical standards   we have a law  which is actually a criminal law  which states that it is a violation of 18 us code 607 for the solicitation of campaign contributions from federal property   the idea behind this change that is included in this rules package is that members should not be required to ca,1

mr speaker  i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this rules package   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  we have a great rules package that is coming before us  a rules package which i believe is deserving of bipartisan support   the reason i say it is deserving of bipartisan support is that is the word that has been used by members on both sides of the aisle to describe exactly what we have been doing here and should be doing here   mr speaker  this package includes a number of very important provisions   it allows us to de,1

mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time   the gentlewoman is correct  i currently serve on the committee on standards of official conduct   and despite what i read in the morning papers  the republican leadership is eliminating a major traditional ethics standard of the house   while we are relieved that the republican leadership did not go as far as they wanted to  i do not think we can be happy with the trend that is clearly downwards as it is today   the new rule mea,0
mr speaker  i am pleased that the rules package includes a provision that will make the homeland security committee a permanent committee   more importantly  we will be giving the committee real oversight and legislative jurisdiction   but i am disappointed that the majority has only given shared jurisdiction to the homeland security committee in some areas   this creates the potential for ongoing turf battles that the 911 commission warned against   i am also discouraged that the majori,0
mr speaker  i strongly oppose the changes in the house ethics rules that the republican majority is seeking to adopt today   the proposed republican rule changes would cripple the ethics process in the house and dramatically lower the bar for standards of official conduct   late yesterday  the republican majority in the house released the details of its rules package for the 109th congress   some of the newspapers reported this morning that the majority had abandoned its efforts to loosen ,0
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the proposed changes in the ethics rules   i served for 8 years on the committee on standards of official conduct  and it is not an enviable assignment   but members who have never served on the committee would be proud of how these tasks are approached   it is a committee that is evenly split   in the 8 years i served  we had unanimous votes   the members who serve think about the institution   they are there to serve the american people and the ins,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  the first day of a new congress should be a day for hope   it should be a day when all of us look forward with optimism to the work ahead   but today is not that kind of day   instead  the leadership of this house is beginning the new year in the worst possible way  by gutting the ethical standards of the united states house of representatives   talk about starting off on the wrong foot   in the rules package,0

mr speaker  i rise in opposition to h res 5  to the republican rules package   specifically  i oppose the proposed changes to rule x  which among other things creates a permanent standing committee on homeland security and grants legislative jurisdiction to that committee   i am not opposed to the creation of a permanent homeland security committee   indeed  i believe that the homeland security committee should be made permanent and should be granted jurisdiction over the overall home,0
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to what i consider a shameless rules package which will undermine the ethical standards held by this house   after the elections in november  the first thing the republican majority did was to lower the house s ethical standard   in an act of unprecedented shamelessness  they changed the rule of their party to permit an indicted member of their party to remain in a leadership position   yesterday  in the face of an overwhelming bipartisan and public cond,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  all over washington and in the country  people are talking today about the majority s lastminute decision to abandon rules changes that would have eviscerated longstanding ethical guidelines in this house  and  with that  the integrity of the institution   and while in the end the majority was right to withdraw these provisions  they hardly deserve our congratulations   the republicans simply succumbed to tough cri,0
mr speaker  after the vote on the previous question  i will call for a yes vote on the motion to commit   my motion to commit will prohibit sitting members of congress from negotiating for future employment with any person who has a direct interest in the legislation referred to any committee on which that member serves   it also includes a rules change that would require a twothirds vote in the house to waive the requirement in our standing rules that members must have 3 days to read the ,0

mr chairman  if the gentleman will yield further  i do not mean to reiterate or repeat too much   looking at the history of these congressional gold medals  though  i think is very telling in terms of what we are doing because the history has always been to individuals for outstanding achievement   so in terms of the groups  i really think we should honor that   that is not disrespectful of any group that has gotten it or all the other groups who are potentially eligible out there if yo,1
mr chairman  i made a couple of these points before  and again i will not repeat too much here  but first and foremost is the 290 signatures   i do not know if one party is ever going to have 290 members or not  i sort of doubt it  at least in the time most of us are around here  and you need both parties in order do this   i learned with the coin that i did  which was benjamin franklin   i can not tell you  and hardly anyone can tell you  whether benjamin franklin was or would have,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   in listening to the sponsor in terms of the need for this legislation  one could intimate by the introduction that possibly medals were given out in a haphazard manner   i mentioned before it takes twothirds of the members of the house  the entire body  to introduce a gold medal for its consideration in the committee on financial services  a bar that i believe is a very  very high bar and one that is not easily attained   i woul,0
mr chairman  would it be safe to say under regular order if this legislation were passed that the code talkers  under regular order  and that was an extraordinary provision made in the appropriations process  under regular order would they be eligible to receive this medal in the future if this bill were to pass   ,0
mr chairman  if the gentleman will continue to yield  that is the point i am trying to make   to say that the code talkers  and i am not saying the gentleman is suggesting this  but to suggest that they did not deserve the ultimate award  even as a group  for what they provided to the service of this country during world war ii is just ridiculous   they certainly deserved as a group   any one individual  no   there were multiple individuals who provided an incredible service to us  ,0
mr chairman  i want to recognize the significance of this medal  that it is not given out willynilly  that  as i mentioned before  it takes extraordinary measures to get enough support to get this medal passed   i recognize that the first person who received this medal was general george washington  prior to him becoming president of the united states  when the country was brand new  when we did not have the richness of diversity and of events that have taken place throughout the hist,0
if the gentleman will yield further  let me just make a point   i appreciate what the gentleman from delaware has said   the reality is  though  a country of 300 million people  only 20 medals have been awarded in the past decade   that is not an awful lot of medals   the point that the gentleman is making is that it has been extraordinary when we have actually issued this medal to groups   why are we now limiting ourselves  when it is extraordinary  recognized as extraordinary  why ,0
mr chairman  i demand a recorded vote  and pending that  i make the point of order that a quorum is not present   ,0
mr chairman  i appreciate the gentleman s comments   i know that the gentleman does not approach this in any other fashion but a bipartisan fashion   but the question i have is if we are going to limit this to two per year  it could be that five members on our side of the aisle have five individuals they want to recognize   there could be five individuals on the republican side of the aisle who have five individuals they want to recognize   that is 10 people  10 bills  10 instances whe,0
mr chairman  if the gentleman will yield further  the rules will have changed once we pass this bill  whereas right now it is unlimited   granted  where it is unlimited  there has not been this rush to introduce bills   as the gentleman mentioned before  this is not done in a very quick fashion   this is done in a bipartisan way   but when we limit it to two per year  we are putting a cap on it  i think we can in the future find ourselves in a situation where  all right maybe five ,0
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   unfortunately  i think that in the past there may have been some politics involved   i understand that one of my colleagues on this side had achieved the requisite number of signatures for a commemorative gold medal for the columbia 107 in the last congress  in the middle of the last congress  and that was never awarded   so i do not know why   i do not know if there was any reason for that  when the requisite number of signature,0

yes  i am opposed to the bill in its current form   ,0
mr speaker  today we begin the 109th congress in earnest  and we do so by considering a bill that we do not need to act on for a problem that  in our view and in the view of many of my colleagues  simply does not exist   we considered this bill today not in the spirit of openness and bipartisanship that should categorize the democratic debate in the house  but with a restrictive rule that did not allow us to have a debate on a key issue  whether one of the highest honors that can be best,0

reclaiming my time  and the gentleman may want to respond   let me just comment   there is an avenue  i would suggest to my friend from new york  to honor large groups   that would be the commemorative coin   it is somewhat ironic that after the reforms that were made by the gentleman from delaware where we tightened the restrictions on commemorative coins  and for good reason  that we then had this increase in the gold medal   i think we can safely say that the gold medal traditionall,1

to begin  mr speaker  it is absolutely backwards to decry this policy of excluding recruiters from using the facilities of a university   let us be clear  no university can ban a recruiter from coming to that city or that town   no university can say that students will not talk to the recruiter   the question is not whether the recruiters can come and advertise  it is whether they can compel the university to offer its facilities involving a policy with which they disagree   but to say ,0

mr chairman  today s bill would not be nearly as flawed or controversial if it had the benefit of going through the committee process   unfortunately  we are faced with costly legislation that overturns states rights and does little to address the problems of our immigration system or to protect americans from another terrorist attack   instead  this bill places enormous regulatory and financial burdens on state governments and makes department of motor vehicles  dmv  employees de facto,0

i thought what the gentleman from wisconsin  mr obey   did by making a performance of duty was a wise thing   i think that was a wise move of the gentleman   i do not know why the gentleman would be upset with regard to my remarks on performance of duty because what the gentleman from wisconsin  mr obey   did is followed what we  the gentleman from illinois  mr evans   and i  had also recommended   performance of duty is a good thing   ,1
i do not have a problem with the performance of duty   i have come to the floor to express some concerns with regard to the identification of an insurance product   we are turning it into an indemnity and a gratuity with regard to an insurance product   we have to be smart about our business with regard to how we proceed   that is my purpose of being here   it is not to reach into the treasury and just say we are going to give this money out   ,1
but it does and i gave the example because you can have someone who has an accidental death or a duty nonperformance in the service   ,1
i will be more than happy to get the gentleman legal counsel so he can understand what he has written   ,1
i thank the gentleman   what the gentleman from wisconsin  mr obey   did with regard to performance   ,1
i believe that the performance of duty that is in the bill  what it does  it does identify with regard to who will receive payment and who do not receive payments   that was why i used the word `` limited  or `` restricted  because you could have an individual  mr chairman  of whom died in an auto accident  was murdered  or something happened to them and they do not qualify   ,1
absolutely   that is why what we have here are two individuals of whom understand what we are talking about but probably have a  well  anyway  let us not use semantics   what i do wish to do as we proceed forward as we go to conference working with the senate is work also with the administration  work with the department of defense  the va and omb to make sure that we bring a proper identity with regard to service and group life insurance that also subsidizes veterans group life insurance,1
mr speaker  i rise today in support of the rule on hr 418   our nation s immigration policy has been of top concern in recent years  and for good reason   with between eight and twelve million illegal aliens in the united states  it is obviously a problem out of control   we need to increase border security and fix our immigration laws   we need a system that will encourage wellintentioned  contributing aliens out of the shadows and allow them to pay a reasonable penalty so they can,1
mr chairman  i would like to submit a statement for the record from the americans for tax reform   february 9  2005   our nation s immigration and border control policies cry out for reform   while our best border control officers should be preventing the next terrorist incursion into our country  they are instead hunting down willing workers   the attacks of september 11th called for new and updated thinking in all areas of federal law enforcement  and immigration reform has been a gl,1
mr chairman  i congratulate the chairman and the committee on government reform for reporting out this bill that is so important that this congress take action on and take action on now   of course we need to do this   of course we need to pass the real id act   because as the chairman just said  certainly all of us who board planes want to know that there is some integrity to our id system in this country and that terrorists are not boarding planes by the use of a stateissued identificat,1
mr speaker  i rise today to voice my strong support for hr 1268  the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense  the global war on terror  and tsunami relief   this essential legislation will support and defend america s values both at home and abroad   our troops serving in iraq will have the necessary tools to continue their rebuilding efforts in iraq and to continue the war on terror   at home  the real id provisions will strengthen our nation s driver s license laws ,1
mr chairman  i move to strike the last word   ,0
mr speaker  i rise in support of hr 1268  to authorize emergency supplemental appropriations for our military   the vast majority of this  82 billion bill will go directly to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan   congress has a responsibility to work with the president to protect the national security of our nation   when our soldiers are sent in to war  it is the congress  responsibility to make sure that all resources necessary are provided to carry out their missions   i st,0
mr chairman  i yield myself 1 minute  because i think the gentlewoman from texas has made some very valid points that need to be discussed   one thing that is important and what we have done here is to understand that there has to be a conviction in this situation by a court of law before it can be entered into a database of the transportation security administration   that is very important   it gives all the protection of what could happen there   we thought a lot about that because it ,1
mr chairman  i thank the gentlewoman for her good questions and for yielding   we are not sure at this point whether they include that information or not at tsa  because simply they have databases and we do not know necessarily what is in their databases  and i do not blame them at all   they are not prone to reveal all of that   it is our judgment they should be doing this   we hope that they would be doing it   we do not know if they are for sure or not   i can not confirm or deny th,1
yes   ,1
mr chairman  if the gentlewoman would yield further  no  i would not have objected to having hearings   it is relatively simple   i do not mean to suggest it needs panels of hearings  but i never object to having a hearing   mr chairman  i believe the gentlewoman from texas  ms jacksonlee   has the right to close   ,1
mr chairman  i rise in strong support of the real id act  and i want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary  the gentleman from wisconsin  mr sensenbrenner    for his efforts in this matter   it is very important   this bill is about common sense   it is about protecting our borders and making our country safer   the 911 commission report revealed many disconcerting facts  none more unnerving than the fact that all but one of the 911 hijackers who we,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman from texas for yielding me this time   i would like to join in the point that is being made by the gentlewoman from texas to remind all of our friends that when republicans took power in 1994  they made a solemn promise to the states that they would make sure that there would be no imposition of unfunded mandates on those states  and today we have a chance to redeem that promise by voting `` no  on consideration of this rule  which waives the unfunded ,0

mr chairman  i need my friend to know that they are in the process of having the claim heard   it has not been terminated or it is not all over   but we are arguing the substance   what i was trying to figure out is  what inspired the gentleman at this late point in the proceedings  since we had hearings last year  we had no hearings this year  and we just found out about this yesterday   ,0

mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this supplemental appropriations bill and the antiimmigrant legislation it contains   if we truly believe all the rhetoric we hear about the importance of freedom and liberty from the president and others  we will vote down this bill  which denies so much freedom and liberty to immigrants in our own country   hr 1268 includes numerous provisions limiting the rights of refugees  imposing onerous new driver s license requirements on the states ,0

mr chairman  several provisions in this legislation are of particular interest to the committee on homeland security   first  this spending bill will be procedurally consolidated with the real id act  which the house approved 261161 on february 10  2005   we can not effectively fight terrorism if we can not verify the identity of people boarding airplanes  entering nuclear power plants  visiting the white house  or gaining access to any of the countless places a terrorist could use as,1
mr chairman  on september 11th  the terrorists did nt just use box cutters and airplanes to attack america  they used our own laws against us to help them murder thousands of people   hr 418  the real id act  will fix these loopholes in current law and also take steps to close gaping holes in our land borders  which are the first line of defense against terrorist infiltration  not just for the border states  but also for my home state of wyoming and the rest of the nation   we all ,1
mr chairman  i reject the statement made a minute ago that this is an antiimmigration bill   i support the sensenbrenner bill   i think security is a national issue   but to suggest that this is an antiimmigrant bill is  in my opinion  wrong   we support legal immigration into this country   it is what has made this country so great   but we also need to take care of security   if you want to come in on a visa  you want to come in to be a citizen  support it   but if you are here,1
mr chairman  i would say to my friend  the gentleman from california  mr farr    during the last debate i invited him to come down and look at the 7mile area in that fence  because it is a problem   i am looking forward to working with him  because if you are an environmentalist  it is hard pan   i mean  it has totally destroyed the plants  the animals  the lizards  and it is like a venturi tube   the gentleman from california  mr hunter   first came to me in 1990 and asked ,1

mr chairman  may i inquire of the time on each side   ,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i note on page 390 of the 911 commission report  it recommends secure identification should begin in the united states   the federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification such as driver s licenses   ,1
mr chairman  i look forward to working with the gentleman from virginia  mr moran   on this issue as we move forward   ,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   let me just sum up and say this does not require anything from the states as far as driver s licenses go   states do not have to do anything under this for their driver s licenses   they can issue driver s licenses to whomever they want   but if they intend to use those licenses for federal purposes  we have a right to say what the criteria should be and under those circumstances  they are going to have to show legal presence  ,1

mr speaker  i rise in support of the war supplemental appropriations act but must voice my incredible misgivings for what the republican majority has attached to legislation that should solely be about how we provide for our brave men and women in harm s way in iraq and afghanistan   there is much in this bill to be proud of   our military  despite the job of the civilian brass and this congress  have been performing heroically   they have accomplished much more than we could have ever h,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   mr speaker  the real id act is a real travesty   it has little to do with homeland security  and it represents just the latest in a string of antiimmigrant proposals so unfortunately popular with certain of our republican colleagues   instead of putting the safety of our families first  these are the same folks that would have turned our emergency room doctors into border patrol agents  who would have cut the funding to cities t,0

mr speaker  let me reiterate what i said about nitpicking and arcane rules   this whole bill is a violation of the rules of the house except for the fact that it says in the bill it does not violate the rules   so telling us that we should have respect for the rules  my colleagues ought to show some respect for the good sense of the american people  for common sense   this whole bill is a violation of the rules without a waiver   is that not true  mr chairman   would this bill be a vi,0

mr chairman  i come to the floor today to speak in support of the real id act   it is clear that in order to secure our country from terrorists we need to reform the requirements and standards for driver s licenses   a valid driver s license is like a hall pass that allows terrorists to easily roam throughout the united states   indeed 19 terrorists did just that with dozens of legal driver s licenses and identification cards   the hijackers used these ids to rent cars and apartments  ,1

mr leader  with respect to the energy bill  it is my understanding that there is some discussion that the energy bill may proceed not next week but the week following   can you tell me whether that is a reasonable possibility  or probability   ,0
mr leader  i might say that i think all of us understand the importance of energy legislation   all of us understand the necessity to become energy independent   i would suggest  in that framework  that i think personally that we can pass an energy bill   obviously  there are some items that are in the energy bill or that are proposed for the energy bill that have significant opposition on one side of the aisle or the other   i would hope  mr leader  if we could  in working with the,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for referencing the committee on ways and means  but i certainly agree with him that having the gentleman from california  mr thomas   and the gentleman from new york  mr rangel   work closely together  and perhaps their respective chairs of the subcommittees that might deal with that work together  would be very  very useful to accomplishing an objective as opposed to simply passing a bill that then languishes in the congress and never gets to the p,0
mr speaker  i would hope on that bill  because of its great importance to the security of the nation and to all of our consumers of energy  which is to say all of us  that we would have as broad a consideration of it as possible so that we could get everybody s ideas put on the floor  voted up or down  and move the bill with as big a consensus as we can accomplish   mr speaker  i thank the majority leader   ,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i am of course going to vote for this emergency supplemental appropriation because i believe it is absolutely imperative to support our brave men and women in harm s way in afghanistan and iraq   i know that even today  2 years after the onset of operation iraqi freedom  there continues to be strong disagreement across the nation on the decision to remove the brutal hussein regime as well as the planning and prose,0
mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time   we started this fence about 20 years ago   we started it by building the first steel fence across that 14mile segment between the coastal hills of san diego county and the pacific ocean   we did that because drug trucks were running that border at the rate of about 300 per month   we had about 10 people being murdered each year  along with numerous robberies and rapes  to such a high degree that the bestselling book  `` lin,1

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i thank my colleague from texas for his comments   i think i can start out by saying that we come from a state that is very diligent and as well very astute on their members of congress supporting unfunded mandates to a burdened and already overworked state budget in a growing state that would have added responsibilities with this enormous burden that this real id bill would exercise against it   let me just say to the gentleman from t,0

mr chairman  do i have time for a unanimous consent request   ,0
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   let me make a point that i think should be very clear   this legislation will not just impact those who are undocumented   this legislation will impact those immigrants who have legal status   in the process of reviewing or revising that status  they too become part of the large webbed fishnet of hauling people in by people who are inexperienced in this area   so i would offer to my colleagues that this is random  it is reckless ,0
mr chairman  reclaiming my time  let me pointedly ask the gentleman  you speak specifically to a judicial conviction going through  as opposed to being tapped and saying  you are carrying a false driver s license   ,0
the gentleman is talking about actually trial and conviction   ,0
mr chairman  reclaiming my time and i would simply say the comment on this is that i appreciate the distinguished gentleman from delaware being open with his response   one of the concerns i have is that we do not know whether dhs is doing this or what tsa is doing and hearings would have been appropriate   this is a valid issue  let us not doubt that  and  of course  i would hope that we would want a database to be secured   i do have to raise red flags on making sure it is not random ,0

mr speaker  i rise sadly to oppose the emergency supplemental because of the horrific and illadvised immigration provisions and the lack of oversight that has been given to the provisions in this section   i hope we will have an opportunity to address this in a comprehensive manner   mr speaker  i rise today very conflicted over a piece of vital legislation for which this entire body should really be in solidarity   the conference report on hr 1268 provides for emergency fy2005 funds f,0
mr chairman  i rise in reluctant support for the  811 billion emergency supplemental funding bill we are considering today   the only reason i am voting for the bill before us today is because it provides much needed equipment for our forces in theater  increases death gratuity to  100  000 for families of soldiers who have died or were killed on active duty   my support for this measure is tepid at best   what troubles me the most about this bill are two key concerns  one  there are,0
mr speaker  when hr 1268 was first considered on the floor in march  i reluctantly supported its passage   now that the conference report has been returned to the house for this chamber s approval  i still find myself torn because i do not see how additional funding for the iraq war effort will ultimately produce a positive outcome for the united states or for the people in iraq   i want a successful exit strategy  not a permanent occupation in iraq   despite my misgivings for the di,0

mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr chairman  i would take a moment to suggest to the gentleman that he may not be aware of it because he does not serve on those subcommittees  but there were at least six hearings in a variety of subcommittees and other meetings regarding this matter before we got organized   mr chairman  i reserve the balance of my time   ,1

i have asked for a ruling of the chair   ,1
mr chairman  i would simply say it is our intention to pursue the questions the gentlewoman is asking   it may very well be in conference on the supplemental that it is appropriate  but frankly in some ways we take from peter to pay paul   we can pursue this is regular order  and i prefer to use the supplemental process for those emergencies that we can not deal with in regular order   because of that  i am not pursuing the recommendations at this time   we will follow through  however,1
mr chairman  in that event  i withdraw my point of order   ,1
madam chairman  speaking further on the point of order  i would simply  calmly say to the gentleman that i very much agree  as the entire house agrees  that we must be responsive to the medical needs of our veterans  especially those who are coming back at this very moment   there is not any doubt that the new military quality of life and veterans affairs  and related agencies subcommittee is designed in the fashion to be very responsive to the needs of veterans   i urge the gentleman t,1

mr speaker  to understand the need for s 5  we need to understand the game the class action lawyers play here and how they go about abusing the court systems   i call it class action monopoly   here is how it works   they start at go   the first thing they do is come up with an idea for a lawsuit   and then they find a named plaintiff   it does not have to be someone who is actually injured in the process   all the lawyer really needs is an idea for a lawsuit and potential defendants ,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of the class action fairness act because we can not act fast enough   we have been trying to act to address the dire needs of our nation s judicial system   today  predatory lawyers take advantage of class action law by shopping for venues where they can find sympathetic judges and juries   each time a lawyer goes venue shopping  it costs taxpayers and it costs our economy by bogging down job creators with frivolous and excessive litigation   national revie,1

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  i would like to briefly describe why this substitute is the superior piece of legislation before us today   the substitute is much better for the following reasons  civil rights carveout   the substitute would carve out state civil rights claims in order to make sure that civil rights plaintiffs  especially those seeking immediate injunctive relief  can have their grievances addressed in a timely manner   believe me ,0

once again  mr speaker  we have before us a bill that would sweep aside generations of state laws that protect consumers   citizens will be denied their basic right to use their own state courts to file class action lawsuits against companies  even if there are clear violations of state labor laws or state civil rights laws   this bill comes after a lobbying campaign costing business interests tens of millions of dollars   well  that was money well spent   with this sweeping legislatio,0

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  in response to some of the comments that were made by the gentleman from massachusetts  i want to share with my colleagues some facts   the class action fairness act contains several provisions specifically designed to ensure that class members  not their attorneys  class members  not their attorneys  are the primary beneficiaries of the classaction process   for example  the act  number one  requires that judges,1

madam speaker  i thank the chairman very much for yielding   madam speaker  the general principles behind s 5 and many of the provisions in the legislation are similar to those in hr 1115  which the house passed in 2003  and s 274  which was voted out of committee in the senate in 2003 but did not ultimately pass   to the extent these provisions are the same  the house committee on the judiciary s report on hr 1115 and the senate committee on the judiciary s report on s 274 refl,1
madam speaker  i would also like to discuss the home state exception in the legislation   new subsections 1332  d   3  and  d   4   b  address the jurisdictional principles that will apply to class actions filed against the defendant in its home state  dividing such cases into three categories   first  for cases in which twothirds or more of the members of the plaintiff class and the primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the suit was filed  section 1332  d   4,1
i thank the chairman for yielding to me   i think those examples really reflect the intent of the legislation   madam speaker  the legislation also includes a local controversy exception which is intended to ensure that truly local class actions can remain in state court under the legislation   under this provision  federal courts are instructed not to exercise jurisdiction over cases that meet all of the following four criteria  first  more than twothirds of the class members must be th,1
i thank the chairman for yielding once again   madam speaker  in this regard i think it is important to note that the exceptions in this legislation are just that  exceptions  and they should not be interpreted in ways that turn them into loopholes   for example  the legislation excludes actions against states   obviously  this does not mean that plaintiffs can simply name a state in every consumer class action and stay out of federal court   to the contrary  federal courts should proc,1

mr speaker  given the large number of suits already filed and the fact that every former vioxx taker in america is already a proposed class member in numerous class actions  it is unlikely there will be many more class actions after the legislation is enacted   it is bad legislation to have something pass that covers all class actions in the country for all time and name one specific product or one specific company in the legislation   it is irrelevant anyway   now  let me tell you the ki,1
mr speaker  i would like to thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak on this bill today   he has been leading a very important discussion and one that i am very pleased has finally come to fruition   mr speaker  there has been a lot of discussion today about class actions and what they do to the economy  class actions  what they have done to law  because state courts are making national law   but i think the most important point about a class action is that a class action s pu,1

mr speaker  it is interesting to hear the distinguished gentleman from georgia mention the committee on rules  and i respect the power of the committee on rules   the committee on rules is not a jurisdictional committee   this bill did not go through the committee process on the senate side or on the house side   i might also say when we talk about coupons and the amount of dollars that lawyers may receive  might i remind the body that we are talking about thousands upon thousands of plai,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for the time that he has spent on this legislation   i think we have seen this come across our desks for a number of sessions  and we have tried to work in a bipartisan manner in order to find a way to respond to some of the larger class actions that are now proceeding before us in the courts   mr speaker  let me start out by trying to address some of the large dilemmas that have seemingly been the underpinnings of this overhaul of a system that is not br,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  the bottom line is that class action reform is badly needed   currently  crafty lawyers are able to game the system by filing large  nationwide class action suits in certain preferred state courts such as madison county  illinois  where judges are quick to certify classes and quick to approve settlements that give the lawyers millions of dollars in fees and give the clients worthless coupons   let us take a look,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for his excellent work on this very important piece of legislation   i rise in opposition to this rule and i rise in opposition to the underlying legislation   in the 1960s  president kennedy used to say  `` ask not what your country can do for you  but what you can do for your country  today  republican leaders in washington have issued a new challenge  `` ask not what your country can do for you  but what you can do for the country club  that i,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  my colleague from georgia had kind of quoted from a study implying that most of these classaction cases would remain in states  that the whole purpose of this bill is to try to move them to federal courts   let me quote from a cbo cost estimate which says that under this bill  most classaction lawsuits would be heard in federal district court  rather than in the state court   ,0

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   let me close by saying  this bill is not about lawyers   it is about people  and it is about state governments and attorney generals being able to pass laws in their own states to better protect their people   and it is ironic and it is almost kind of laughable that the majority  which has made it a point to argue on behalf of states right  is basically turning its back on what states have done to protect their people   the previo,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time  even though i am in opposition to his position and favor this bill   this is not a radical bill  nor is it regressive   in fact  it is a reasonable compromise designed to address what is an abuse of the judicial system   that is why the washington post endorses this bill   it is why the democratic senators from new york  california  and illinois all voted for the bill   in fact  democratic senators representing 19 states voted ,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this legislation   today republicans are bringing to the floor as their first major legislative action a payback to big business at the expense of consumers   the republican agenda is to ensure that some americans do not get their day in court   make no mistake that this class action bill before us today is an extreme bill   it is not a compromise bill as some have claimed   it is an extreme bill that is an injustice to consumers and a windfall f,0
mr speaker  the class action fairness act could not be more inappropriately named  and this motion to commit shows why   since 1999  merck has spent over  100 million a year to advertise vioxx   more than 80 million people took vioxx  and the drug generated sales of  25 billion for merck   merck should take responsibility for the harm their products may cause   thousands  literally thousands of american families believe they lost a loved one or suffered personal harm because vioxx w,0

madam speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   madam speaker  i rise in strong support of s 5  the class action fairness act of 2005   today marks the culmination of nearly a decade of legislative efforts to end systematic abuse of our nation s class action system   we stand on the cusp of sending landmark legislation on civiljustice reform to the president that has been approved by increasing majorities each time it has been considered by the house in each of the last three,1
madam speaker  first  i have a lengthy additional statement explaining how this bill is to work   we do not have the time in general debate for me to give this statement on the floor  so i will insert the statement relative to the intent of the managers of the bill in the record at this point   madam speaker  i would like to provide a brief summary of the provisions in sections 4 and 5 of s 5  the class action fairness act of 2005   section 4 gives federal courts jurisdiction over class,1
madam speaker  reclaiming my time  i appreciate the gentleman s question   section 4 of the bill gives federal courts jurisdiction over class action lawsuits in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of  5 million  excluding interests and costs and at least one proposed class member and one defendant are citizens of different states or countries   for purposes of the citizenship element of this analysis  s 5 does not alter current law   thus  a corporation will conti,1
madam speaker  reclaiming my time  under new subsection 1332  d   6   the claims of the individual class members in any class action shall be aggregated to determine whether the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of  5 million   the sponsors intend this subsection to be interpreted broadly  and if a purported class action is removed under this provision  the plaintiff shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the  5 million threshold is not satisfied   by the same toke,1
reclaiming my time  madam speaker  i am pleased to answer the gentleman   the first factor is whether the claims asserted are of significant national or interstate interest   under this factor  if a case presents issues of national or interstate significance that argues in favor of the matter being handled in federal court  for example  if a class action alleges a nationally distributed pharmaceutical product caused side effects  those cases presumably should be heard in federal court be,1
madam speaker  reclaiming my time  yes  this provision is intended to respond to concerns that class actions with a truly local focus should not be moved to federal court under this legislation because state courts have a strong interest in adjudicating such disputes   at the same time  this is a narrow exception that was carefully drafted to ensure that it does not become a jurisdictional loophole   thus  each of the criteria is intended to identify a truly local class action   first  ,1
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  i will be happy to explain   the mass action provision was included in the bill because mass actions are really class actions in disguise   they involve an element of people who want their claims adjudicated together  and they often result in the same abuses as class actions   in fact  sometimes the abuses are even worse because the lawyers seek to join claims that have little to do with each other and confuse a jury into awarding millions of dollars to in,1
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  once again  critics of the legislation have it backwards   this legislation will streamline jurisdictional inquiries by putting an end to all of the gaming that takes place under the current system  and the socalled delay refers to procedural rules that already exist under the current system   under existing law  diversity of citizenship between the parties must exist  both at the time a complaint is filed and at the time a complaint is removed to federa,1

mr speaker  i always thought that federal judges protected the rights of everybody   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of the time   mr speaker  notwithstanding what we have heard from opponents of this legislation  its passage would not extinguish the legal right of any injured party  whether it be a class action  a mass action  or an individual lawsuit from proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction in the united states   what the bill does do is it puts some sense into the class action system so that the members of the plaintiff s class will be fairly and,1

mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of s 5  the class action fairness act   this legislation will work to balance class actions   currently  plaintiffs  lawyers take advantage of the system by bringing large  national lawsuits in specific jurisdictions with relaxed certification criteria   attorneys are increasingly filing interstate class actions in state courts  mostly in what are known as `` magnet  jurisdictions   courts in these jurisdictions are attractive to lawyers because they r,1

mr speaker  the house has considered similar legislation in 1999  2002  and 2003   on each of those occasions  i voted `` no   not because i was unalterably opposed to congress acting on this subject  but because in my judgment the defects of those bills outweighed their potential benefits   when it was announced that this bill would be considered  i hoped that the pattern would be broken and that this time i would be able to support the legislation   and if the conyers substitute ,0
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to s 5  the class action fairness act   despite its name  this bill is anything but fair to the class action device that has provided redress to large numbers of american citizens who have been harmed by the same defendant or a group of defendants   class action procedures have made it possible for injured americans to aggregate small claims that might not otherwise warrant the expense of individual litigation   this bill before us will effectively underm,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman very much for yielding me this additional time  and i am surprised that such an able lawyer would be unwilling to engage in a debate on his time  but i will take 30 seconds simply to rebut what the gentleman said   in every one of those cases on the wheel of rhetoric that the gentleman put up  those that were found guilty  those who were found to be responsible  those who were found to be culpable of doing harmful things to our community admitted it  pa,0

mr speaker  the budget resolution sets the priorities of the congress   it is a moral compass for what we stand for  what we believe in   it shows if our priorities are in the right place   it shows whether we are going to provide for the less fortunate or if we will continue to reward the rich and the powerful at the expense of people in need   the mundane minutia that are detailed as budget authority and outlays are actually the blueprints of our nation   i do not like what the republi,0

mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,1
mr speaker  i have taken the time in opposition to this resolution not so much to object to the wellintended notions of the gentlewoman and the promotion of freedom and liberty   it is just that i do not think this is going to achieve it   as a matter of fact  when we pursue resolutions like this and a more aggressive foreign policy of telling other countries what to do  i see it as more of a threat to our security rather than helping our security   i  for one  would admit i personally,0

mr chairman  i rise in support of the cbc budget  a commonsense framework that embraces our values  that focuses on fiscal discipline and that invests in our nation s future   to be frank  the budget that president bush presented us with is a betrayal of the trust that is placed in us as legislators   it violates the commitments that we have made to our children  to our veterans  and to our farmers and it does so while amassing mountains of debt  that we have no means of repaying   ,0

mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   mr chairman  i wish to speak very briefly about an aspect of fiscal responsibility  the rule called payasyougo  because there is a connection between our lack of fiscal responsibility and these draconian cuts we are seeing in vital services  like the  20 billion that people who are poor and dependent on medicaid will be forced to endure   our colleagues in the majority have consistently opposed democratic efforts to reinstall,0
madam chairman  i have some grave concerns about several provisions of this bill   among the most important concerns to marylanders is the fact that this bill cuts clean water funding by  241 million from last year s appropriated level  bringing our financial commitment to clean water down to 1989 funding levels   this money  in the clean water state revolving fund  pays for sewage system upgrades across the country   we in maryland know how incredibly important this money is to prot,0

mr chairman  if i were voting for a budget that cut veterans benefits by  14 billion over the next 5 years  i guess i would want to talk about the past rather than the future as well   the difference is very clear  and it is very simple   republicans voting for this bill say that it is okay to cut veterans health care benefits by  14 billion over the next 5 years   democrats and national veterans organizations say it is wrong   in fact  the dav  the vfw say it is a grossly inadequate,0

mr chairman  we are here today in this chamber to consider a fantasy budget   it is ludicrous for the house leadership to move forward with this budget debate by ignoring the issues of the day merely to lock in huge tax cuts and offer damaging spending cuts to health care  education  veterans  services and much more   we need a better plan   the democratic alternative that i support would reinstate the payasyougo rule and balance the budget by 2012  just as the baby boomers begin the,0

mr speaker  i rise today to express my concern about the current state of our nation s budget woes   i ve been running the family ranch for several years and i know what it means to work within a budget   you may have to count your pennies  but you spend your money where it matters the most to you and your community   this administration proposes to cut funding for agricultural programs in addition to denying promised benefits to veterans and military widows   these are the wrong priori,0
mr chairman  i found the rhetoric on the budget particularly interesting over the course of a wide variety of issues   one near and dear to my heart is the issue of veterans care   i can speak to this issue with a great deal of authority that very few of my colleagues in this body can as a member of the american legion  a member of the 82nd airborne division association  a member of the army ranger association and a member of the association of graduates of the united states military acade,1
mr chairman  i want to first start by thanking the gentleman from texas for offering this budget alternative   i think it is a fiscally conservative  sane budget and i think it is much needed here in washington  dc   furthermore  i would like to thank the gentleman from iowa  mr nussle    the chairman of the committee on the budget  for putting forward a very strong  fiscally conservative  reasonable budget for the american people that is not just good for our priorities here in w,1
mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   first  i commend the gentleman from north carolina  mr watt   for offering a budget alternative   i know that the gentleman and his staff  along with the other members of the congressional black caucus  worked very hard to put this budget together   working on the committee on the budget this year  i realize how difficult it is to get agreement on the type of budget we need   even to get a small group of people to agree ,1
mr chairman  i do want to respond to only the big dogs eat in this house   i am a small dog  and i think i am doing just fine   ,1
mr chairman  reclaiming my time  this is an interesting chart on the rapid increase in veterans spending per veteran   i think this is very important   we are spending  2  773 per veteran   we are fully funding our veterans  needs   that is a priority of this congress   as a small fellow  i must admit  i do think it is important that we keep our taxes low so that we can create economic growth and development which will help us fully fund our programs going forward   a strong econom,1
i am full of charts today  my friends   i do want to address our funding for health and for research   under a republicancontrolled congress  we have doubled funding for nih  the national institutes of health   i think it is important to note what we are doing in health research as an american government  and the american people need to know that we are fully funding these programs to look at innovative ways to solve pressing medical issues in our country   we have doubled the funding f,1
mr chairman  i think i may have a chart on that   payroll jobs have rebounded because of tax cuts   with a weakness of the economy going into the bush administration from the clinton years and with the advent of 911  we had a weakening of the economy   but once the tax cuts took hold  we have rebounded   we have got over 3 million jobs because of this   beyond that  there has been reference to the fact that tax cuts have created the deficit   that is not true   actually  that is bo,1
mr chairman  again i want to commend the gentleman from north carolina  mr watt   for offering this alternative budget   i do commend him for his hard work and efforts on behalf of his constituents  which are my neighbors in north carolina   i am very proud to have him as a neighbor   i am very proud of his leadership and the stature he brings back home to north carolina   with that  we do have a disagreement on policy   his version of the budget increase taxes at a time when we are ,1
mr chairman  i look forward to having an opportunity to work with my colleagues from oregon and california in the near future in order to address the expansion of casino gambling to offreservation sites   i thank the gentleman for allowing me to address this issue of concern to my district   in my pennsylvania district  the delaware tribes of oklahoma have filed suit in order to acquire the right to establish a casino   their claim is based on a conveyance that allegedly occurred in 1737 ,1
mr chairman  i believe very strongly in balancing our budget and reducing the deficit  but i think we need to set certain priorities that are important to our families   my hope is that we do this in a bipartisan approach  that we develop a consensus  and i do want to thank the gentleman from iowa and the committee for allowing us to put some committee report language dealing with education in the budget and with resultsoriented budgeting which i believe we need here at this house   we n,0
mr speaker  it is sunday evening  a time when those of us in the house of representatives are usually not in session   but tonight is an unusual night and the circumstances before us are unusual   it goes without saying that we of course are discussing the life and death of terri schiavo   the situation that terri is in has been discussed here on this floor tonight already  and you only have to turn on the news or pick up a newspaper to learn about it   however  as i have watched  as i,1
mr speaker  today members of congress have come from all over the country  wta to uphold the most essential right that any of us posses the right to life   as we stand here today  a woman is dying   she dies not as the result of an underlying disease or illness  but because a judge has decided that her life is not one worth living   this despite evidence that she makes attempts to respond to her parents  cries  follows movement with her eyes   with such evidence and her parents crying,1
mr speaker  on this sunday  i have looked into my heart and listened to my god in prayer  and spoken to my pastor and other parishioners in church   my decision this evening is an intensely personal one  in terms of life   as a father  husband  grandfather  and son in law  i have searched my soul about what the family must be going through   as a member of congress  i know it is in our hands to offer what is the ultimate hope for this young woman   we can not guarantee how the cour,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   i do not know what to do tonight   i honestly do not   if terri schiavo were here  she could tell us what she would like her fate to be under this circumstance   those who say that we are condemning her to death by starvation  that may be so if action is not taken tonight   but it may also be so that you may be condemning her to a life that she might not choose were she here to choose that   some of us have spoken on both sides o,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   i thank the speaker  as has already been acknowledged   it is his leadership that has brought this issue to the floor tonight  and again i commend him for that leadership   mr speaker  there has been much said tonight  much eloquence on both sides  about this issue   i fear sometimes that in our effort to try to come to some sort of conclusion that we actually overthink an issue once in a while   we think just enough to g,1
mr speaker  we all know that there are deep emotions that are involved in this debate tonight   and earlier many of us met with terri schiavo s brother  and i do not think that anyone can truly convey what that family is going through   and as a mother  a tragedy of this type is my worst nightmare   but  mr speaker  we  this congress  we are not here simply because we believe in our hearts that a great mistake is about to be made   we are here because all of us  each and every one,1
mr speaker  i thank the chairman for yielding me this time   i also want to thank the speaker for the difficult decision to call the members back  though the difficult decision maybe was made less difficult by the circumstances   the hard work of the gentleman from wisconsin  mr sensenbrenner   over the last few days  of the gentleman from texas  mr delay    majority leader  the work of the gentleman from maryland  mr hoyer    who may not be on the same side as i am when we tak,1
mr speaker  on december 3  1963  theresa marie schindler was born in pennsylvania   at the time  i was pregnant with my first child and my beautiful daughter  danene  was born 5 days later on december 8 she is my best friend and today she  too  is a mom   i certainly can relate to mr and mrs schindler s love for their daughter and their passionate fight to keep her alive   mothers have a precious bond with their daughters   the issues that we are discussing tonight are not becau,0
mr speaker  you have heard all the legal arguments  all the moral arguments   we see these things differently  and i understand that   i am here to speak for myself   i have a living will that i wrote years ago  and i will check it myself as many americans will   the bottom line is  i do not want you interfering with my wife and me   leave us alone   let us make our own decisions   it is not up to you   that has always been the way it has been in this country  and that is the way ,0
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the legislation   mr speaker  i rise first to extend my thoughts and prayers to the loved ones of teresa marie schiavo at this extraordinarily difficult time   america has seen the anguish in the faces of ms schiavo s family members   the legislation we are considering will determine whether we will send to federal court one case that has been adjudicated in florida s state courts for nearly a decade   for the past seven years  this particular case,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time  a girl from indianapolis  indiana   for the life of me  i can not understand why we are here   we were all snatched out of our houses of worship to run to washington to violate the trial of the judicial  the legislative  and the administrative   but i guess the leadership understands what it is   they are calling it a wedge between democrats and republicans  i am calling it what is right and what is wrong   we have no busi,0
mr speaker  when i came here tonight  i had no intention to speak on this issue for  frankly  the most personal of reasons  a year ago my brother and i were involved in making precisely this same kind of decision where my mother was concerned   we were fortunate   we had been empowered by her to make that decision  we were in agreement on the decision  and the medical professionals and her minister agreed with us about that decision   so we got to make that decision in the privacy and,1
mr speaker  tonight i join millions of floridians and americans hoping and praying for terri and her family at this incredibly difficult time   terri schiavo s case is a tragedy we all hope and pray our own families will never go through   and tonight this congress is about to commit a travesty   i think we can agree the impact of this legislation extends far beyond terri schiavo   tonight  congressional leaders are poised to appoint this congress as a judge and a jury   these actions a,0
mr speaker  i ask unanimous consent that upon entry of this order  the speaker may decline to entertain a motion to adjourn until after disposition of the motion to suspend the rules described in this order  that it be in order at any time on sunday  march 20  2005  for the speaker to entertain a motion that the house suspend the rules with respect to s 686  and that such motion be debatable for 3 hours  equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding  and before answering the question  i want to thank the gentleman for all the good work that he has been doing over the last 2 or 3 days under very difficult circumstances   the distinguished whip has worked very long hours  and we greatly appreciate his cooperation and his consultation   i really do thank you for that  mr whip   to answer your question  our intentions are to come in at 9 oclock   we hope to vote at midnight  and  th,1
mr speaker  if the gentleman will continue to yield  the gentleman is absolutely correct   and hopefully  as the gentleman knows  every hour is incredibly important to terry schiavo   the senate has passed the bill  so we will be taking up a senate bill and  hopefully  we will expedite this process as fast as the house rules will allow us   ,1
i appreciate the gentleman s question  and that is the intention   but  hopefully  level heads will prevail  and maybe something will happen  lightning might strike and another agreement may be made   certainly we would not do anything without the distinguished whip s concurrence and okay  in consultation with him  and we will keep the whip advised if there is any unlikely reason for us to come back earlier than 9 oclock   ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman from maryland s words  but i look at it a little differently   after reading all the records and everything  what i do know is that there is a mother  a father  a brother  and a sister that want terri schiavo to live  and they want to take care of her   i want to thank everybody that has worked on this bill  particularly those in the senate  the democrats in the senate  the republicans in the senate   they passed this bill unanimously   i wa,1
mr speaker  as members of congress  we have a moral obligation to protect innocent life and not stand idly by while an activist judge seeks to use extreme measures to destroy the life of an innocent woman   by transferring this matter to a federal court we will ensure terri is given every possible protection by allowing a federal judge to see whether her constitutional rights have been violated   life is precious and i will always work to see that it is protected   with so much controversy,1
mr speaker  it was with heavy hearts and steady resolve that we came to the house chamber on palm sunday to pass s 686  a carefully crafted bill with a singular purpose  to ensure that terri schiavo enjoys the same due process under the constitution as any other citizen  and to guarantee that her right to life is fully protected   this is an extraordinary situation  one that requires an extraordinary response   this is a life or death situation for this young woman   terri s parents s,1
mr speaker  i yield myself 6 minutes   mr speaker  it is never a good recommendation for a bill when its proponents deny its plain meaning   the gentleman from wisconsin said this is not a private bill   well  perhaps in the technical and irrelevant terms of the house calendar it is not a private bill   it is in fact a very private bill   it is so private that it deals only with the schiavo case and her parents   and in an admission that it is not a very good idea  a provision of thi,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 1 minute   the gentleman from wisconsin in an effort to find an inconsistency quoted me as being for habeas corpus so people can have their day in court   i am   i do not ever remember supporting a bill in congress where we decided person by person who got the right of habeas corpus and who did not   my argument is a separationofpowers argument   yes  i believe a general right to go to court when you have claimed there has been an error in your criminal proce,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 1 minute   mr speaker  the previous impassioned speech from a gentleman who legitimately and genuinely holds a very strong opinion here is exactly why we should not  as a congress  be deciding this issue   he made a number of statements about her medical condition   none of us are in a position to know what her medical condition is   there are procedures in the state of florida which have been gone through exhaustively to determine that   doctors have testif,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 1 minute   the caption tonight ought to be `` we are not doctors   we just play them on cspan  the point is this  the gentleman is making specific medical arguments   he has said  in strong criticism of the entire judicial system of the state of florida  that they did not give her a fair chance  that the entire judicial system  all of those appeals  all of those trials  all of that litigation  that that did not give her a fair chance and we will now va,0

mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0
mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 45 seconds   the gentleman s remarks again emphasize that this is a judicial and not a legislative case   he says there are aspects of this case that call for judicial review   that is why we have courts   yes  other people can get other federal review by general statutes   none of the other cases he mentioned are in federal courts because a particular bill was passed in a particular situation to send them there based on a review of those facts   the gentlema,0
mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 30 seconds   it is true that the constitution gives congress the right to provide the jurisdiction of the courts   this bill does that for one individual  which  as the gentleman from georgia s comments make clear  it is based on the facts of the one case   this is not an act of legislation  this is a casebycase adjudication because members here genuinely dislike the outcome of the florida court system   ,0
mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 15 seconds   we just heard what would have made an excellent summary in the legal case in this matter  but not a legislative argument   we heard very specific allegations and arguments which are hotly contested about the individual case   the americans with disabilities act was a general law   it has nothing to do with this individual case here   ,0
mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 20 seconds   the gentleman from wisconsin  mr sensenbrenner   earlier implied that i was being inconsistent because i said i was for habeas corpus   he quoted something   he has just cited the inadequacy of habeas corpus in this case   yes  i am for habeas corpus   this goes  as he just acknowledged  far beyond it   secondly  he acknowledged our objections to this individual private bill on one case by blaming the senate   in other words  he has acknow,0
mr speaker  i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from maryland  mr hoyer    our whip  the ranking member on our side who is here tonight  to close on our side   the minority leader  who is traveling overseas  is unable  obviously  to be here   ,0
mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
mr speaker  in response to the remarks a few minutes ago from the gentleman from massachusetts  i want to say that i am not sure whether or not i am on cspan  but i am absolutely sure that i am not playing doctor  for indeed i am one   mr speaker  i want to thank my colleagues for returning to washington on palm sunday to take up this very important issue   as my colleagues know  we are here today in an attempt to safe the life of terry schiavo   i particularly want to thank the gent,1
mr speaker  i submit this article for the record   this bill must be passed   this congress is right to stand up for a woman who is incapacitated to some extent yes  but does not require extraordinary measures to live   we must allow a thorough review of her case   the love of her family is so great we should honor it   starving for the truth when mary jane owen thinks of terri schiavo  she remembers a day in 1986 and the hospital in washington   pneumonia was filling owen s lungs   ,1
mr speaker  we come here with a heavy heart   i urge the members of this house to do our duty to pass the schiavo act   its purpose is simple  to allow the federal courts to review this matter in the light of terri s constitutional rights   that s not a lot to ask   over the last few days  members of both parties and chambers have worked tirelessly to reach this agreement   we hope that these efforts will help give terri schiavo new hope and a new chance at life   we have heard very,1
mr speaker  as the elected representatives of the american people  we have no greater responsibility than defending the lives and liberties of the most vulnerable among us   today  both the legislative and executive branches of the united states government are acting in concert to defend the life of one such human being  terri schiavo   while the legal issues related to this case remain uncertain  the moral issues could not be more clear   terri schiavo is very much alive today   by al,1
mr speaker  we are turning a sad family tragedy into a grotesque legislative travesty   it is a tragedy   but what we are talking about tonight is nothing other than inserting our judgment for the courts   today every day in every county in america  families  doctors  hospital chaplains are making lifeanddeath decisions  tough decisions and tender decisions   each one has its own circumstance  and congress can not reasonably understand each and should not be involved   for 215 year,0
mr speaker  reserving the right to object  and if the majority leader will answer a question  it is my understanding that we have an agreement that there will be  pursuant to this unanimous consent request  debate on the pending piece of business  the house bill or the senate bill containing the house language  between 9 pm   and 12 midnight this day  is that accurate   ,0
reclaiming my time  mr speaker  the majority leader anticipated my next question   and i appreciate your comments   this is  obviously  a very serious issue and we are prepared to deal with it seriously   we appreciate the fact that this provides for sufficient time in debate for the issues to be raised and addressed by the house of representatives   my second question  which you have anticipated  is that in fact members can expect at 12 midnight  at the conclusion of the 3 hours of ,0
i thank the gentleman for that answer   it is also my understanding  mr leader  that although we will recess to the call of the chair  it would be  as i understand it  the intention of the chair not to recall the house until 9 pm   tonight   ,0
i thank the gentleman for those comments and would make it clear to the house  mr speaker  that of course one of the considerations is members are trying to get back   they have had 17 hours notice of reconvening and with the vote to occur at 12  obviously  9 oclock will have been 14 hours  and the reason we did not want to go sooner is because there are members on either side of this question who would want to make their positions known   so that is the reason for our concern   so i a,0
mr speaker  this has been an extraordinarily serious debate   it has been in many ways a real debate  with each member rising and understanding the seriousness of the issues which we consider   on the one hand  we consider the life of one young woman  a young woman struck by tragedy  shared by her family and by her friends and by her country   one of the striking facts of american life and american culture is the great importance that america puts on the individual  one life  one swal,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   i want to speak from love and compassion  not just the law  and embrace the strongest profamily position as we move in this debate   the schiavo and schindler families need our prayers to do for terry what not a single one of us wishes to imagine  to make a decision on the life of a beloved as they traverse the jagged edge of being   terri s family  all of them  love her   she is not alone   but her being belongs not to ,0
mr speaker  since i was a child and to this very day on the floor of the house i have been guided by a fundamental principle that we as men and women  indeed  we as a society will be judged according to how we treat the most vulnerable amongst us   that is the issue we face today   i believe terri schiavo s case must be judged in that context   for me the following points are the most important  terri left no living will or written instructions  terri s mom and dad  the people that h,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from wisconsin  mr sensenbrenner   for yielding me this time   i wanted the opportunity to address the issue of the funding that has gone in on behalf of terri schiavo  and the report that i have put together  i could easily add several hundred thousand dollars to that that have gone towards attorneys and towards the interests of michael schiavo as opposed to the interests of terri schiavo   i would have a documented report that i would file with the  ,1
mr speaker  15 years ago or so i worked with colleagues in the senate on the difficult issues relating to the wishes of people who were going to receive medical care if they were incapacitated   we required that state laws be told to patients about living wills and advance directives   the florida judicial system has worked hard to follow its laws and to try to discern what was or would have been the wishes of mrs schiavo   section 1 of the bill says  `` the us district court for the mi,0
mr speaker  i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts  mr frank   for yielding me time   mr speaker  why are we here tonight   we have not been ordained or called by some allpowerful force to play god or play doctor   every day american families make lifeanddeath decisions governed by their own faith and led by their own hearts   this congress does not interfere with most personal decisions of these american citizens   why then  mr speaker  why have we come here tonight ,0
mr speaker  this case  what we are doing here tonight  is not about terri schiavo   the evidence for that begins in the way this was brought to this body  being brought in on st   patrick s day at 11  30 at night  with no hearings  no notice to the body  nothing   it was going to be rammed through here without discussion   and what troubles me  and i have heard my colleagues here  as a psychiatrist  i can not make diagnoses of people that i have not examined   that is contrary ,0
mr speaker  i support s 686  for the relief of the parents of theresa marie schiavo   while i continue to support the right of individuals  through living wills  and families  when no living will exists  to make such difficult decisions  this case is unusual in two ways   first  while most families are united in these judgments  this family is clearly divided   second  terri schiavo is not unresponsive to those around her  as is typically the case when these decisions are made  ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for yielding me this time   mr speaker  the most traumatic moment of my life was when my mother died in my arms   she had chosen not to be dependent on a respirator in a hospital but to die at home with her family   these circumstances  or some variant of them  occur eventually within every family  and whether the federal government has the right to intervene in those private tragedies is the issue before us tonight   i talked to te,0
i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for his work   mr speaker  there are doctors in this chamber  there are lawyers in this chamber  there are judges in this chamber   i am none of those  but i am an elected member of congress   i am also a mother   tonight in this gallery my daughter sits   i think of my daughter  i think of my other three children  and i think of the day they were born   i think of the milestones in their lives and the love that i have for them   i think of the ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  this bill is a dangerously reckless way to deal with one of the most serious issues we will ever confront   there is no way to make these judgments easy  even when the express desires of the patients are clear and unambiguous   where there is disagreement on the medical facts or on the wishes of the patient  these cases can be heartrending and sometimes bitter  beyond the comprehension of those who have been fort,0
mr speaker  i did indeed say that there can be federal court review of due process  obviously   that has happened here   and the federal court said  `` not only has ms schiavo s case been given due process in state court  but few if any similar cases have ever been afforded this heightened level of process  the difference in this bill is not that it is a review of state court  but it orders a de novo proceeding to ignore everything that happened in state court as if the state courts,0
mr speaker  tonight i stand with terri s father  a man who raised up his little girl and gave his daughter s hand in marriage with the understanding that she would be protected in sickness and in health  for better or for worse  with terri s mother who brought her into this world and gave her life  and to unite myself with terri s brother who continues to struggle for his sister   together  each of them is simply begging for her life   none of my colleagues on the other side are kin,1
mr speaker  a lot has been said about the details of this case   i just want to say a word about the process  because we should honor and respect the rule of law  and laws should be applied equally to all   this is a special bill  special treatment to just one case   this bill does not grant a federal right of review to cases like this   this bill applies just to this one case   the majority in congress apparently has already decided the proper outcome of the case  a decision differen,0
mr speaker  pursuant to the order of the house of today  i move to suspend the rules and pass the senate bill  s 686  for the relief of the parents of theresa marie schiavo ,1
mr speaker  i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on s 686   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  federal courts have always reviewed whether or not a person s federal constitutional or legal rights have been violated  and that is all this bill does   it gives a federal court the opportunity to review the federal questions that are presented here   now  if we accepted the position that has been made by the opponents of this legislation  we would not have had a civil rights revolution in this country if rural court,1
mr speaker  i yield myself 15 seconds   mr speaker  in 1995  my friend from massachusetts said  in a habeas corpus bill  `` i want judicial review in a reasonable way   i want people who may have had their rights interfered with to be able to sue in reasonable fora  that is what this bill does   he was right then   i think this bill is right now   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself 30 seconds   mr speaker  this bill does not make a decision on whether or not the feeding tube should be reinserted   it does not make a final decision on the issues that are being decided in florida   what it does do is that it says that a federal court  a judge  will review the federal constitutional and legal rights that belong to terri schiavo  and that federal judge will make a decision on federal issues  and that is all the bill does   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself 1 minute   mr speaker  i am a little bit puzzled  listening to my friend from new york   at 151  lt  em  gt   lt  em  gt  congressional record  page h1599  the gentleman from new york  mr nadler   said  `` if a person thinks a court in a state is depriving someone of civil rights  they can go into federal court  and at volume 150  lt  em  gt   lt  em  gt  congressional record at page h6580  the gentleman from new york noted that with,1

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  we meet tonight under extraordinary circumstances  and i for one am very grateful to the speaker and majority leader delay for bringing us back because a muchloved disabled woman in florida has been ordered to die by starvation and dehydration   we meet tonight because terri schiavo s family  including her parents  bob and mary schindler  refuse to allow their precious daughter  who is not in a coma nor is she,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   it is precisely what the gentleman from wisconsin  mr sensenbrenner   has been saying all night   we want the venue to be a federal district court in florida to look at this critical matter from beginning to end to determine what has been missed   there is a benefit of the doubt here that goes to terri   she ought to get it   we do not think she has gotten it   let the court decide   ,1
mr speaker  as a prolifer  i have supported the efforts of the gentleman from florida  mr weldon   to save terri schiavo s life from the beginning  but as i have learned more about this case it is not just a case about traditional life debates   normally those issues are hard  but what is happening in this case is a moral outrage   terri schiavo is not dependent upon life supports   she is dependent upon being fed  only she can not feed herself   years ago  my wife  diane  when,1
mr speaker  as one of 203 democrat and republican members of congress who voted in favor of s 686  a private bill for the relief of the parents of theresa marie schiavo  i am pleased that president bush signed this important piece of legislation that may result in the reinsertion of ms schiavo s feeding tube   the bill empowers a federal court to examine the terri schiavo case   as i listened to my colleagues debating this issue on the house floor last night  i heard many emotional sta,1
mr speaker  many families have had to make incredibly difficult decisions regarding medical support for their loved ones   as technology continues to advance  there will be even more heartwrenching decisions ahead  and any of us could be involved in one   the proper role of the federal government in such decisions is not selfevident to me   certainly  we should not have congress debate  casebycase  what action is or is not appropriate for a particular patient   government at some ,1
mr speaker  our goal must be to honor the wishes of theresa schiavo regarding this difficult endoflife decision   we are a nation of laws   that is what distinguishes our country from so many others   in this case  the courts of the state of florida have thoroughly reviewed the facts of this case and weighed the evidence about what theresa schiavo would want   they have concluded that theresa schiavo  through her words and deeds before her accident  would not want to be kept artificia,0
mr speaker  i just came in on the plane from north carolina  and i found myself thinking a lot about what we are doing here this evening   wondering  first of all  what this vote is going to cost the american people  making a mental calculation that probably 4   5 million we are spending on this one vote this evening  and wondering how many children are going to go to bed hungry tonight and how many we could feed with that amount of money  how many feeding tubes we have withdrawn by o,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time  and i commend him for the work he has put in over the last 4 days to try to bring this bill to the floor   this is not the original version of the bill that i introduced about 2 weeks ago  but i think it will have the intended result   for many people listening and watching  you may get the impression this is a dispute between the democrats and the republicans  but there were 30  approximately 30 democrats on the bill and i know th,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  for those of us from florida  the heartwrenching case involving terri schiavo is not new   in fact  for 15 years mrs schiavo has remained in a persistent vegetative state   for 7 years the courts and the state of florida have heard  ad nauseam  arguments of both sides   there is this perception possibly that only one judge has been involved in this case   in fact  19 judges in the state of florida have participat,0
mr speaker  this is a profound tragedy for the schiavo family  and i sympathize with all of the family members   it is also a deeply personal matter  one which should be decided within the family   no one wants this personal decision to be made by 536 politicians  435 members of the house  100 members of the senate  and the president of the united states   the facts of this tragedy  and the competing wishes of the family members  have already been determined by those best placed to d,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from massachusetts  mr frank   for yielding me time   there are a number of things that i would like to correct for the record before i begin   i apologize for not knowing the state that the gentleman is from  but the representation regarding the care of theresa schiavo by her husband as represented in the chamber is totally inaccurate   theresa s husband  and i am quoting from the guardian ad litem report  the independent guardian ad litem report th,0
mr speaker  our colleagues have spent this evening reiterating factually inaccurate information  and i want to make sure we clear it up   the independent guardian ad litem appointed to represent terri schiavo has said in his report that  despite the facts cited by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have said that terri felt pain and laughs and cries  that that is factually inaccurate  that her cerebral cortex has been liquefied  and that is the area of the brain that respon,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  there have been a lot of charges talked about tonight and a lot of emotion   this is a painful process   as a physician  i have dealt with endoflife decisions in families as they struggle countless times   why is this one different   first and foremost  there is no living will in place  and  second  there is a fundamental disagreement between terri s husband and her parents  two who normally would agree ,1
mr speaker  i shall not try to influence the opinion of anyone on this issue   i will simply share with you my opinion  the opinion of a physician of almost 41 years duration   i am a head and neck surgeon   i have done cancer surgery almost all of those years   i have done much maxillofacial trauma all of those years and dealt with situations like this on numerous occasions   terri schiavo has spontaneous respiratory activities and respontaneous cardiac activity   she is not on life su,1
mr speaker  i have served as the senior pastor of st   james united methodist church for 30 years  for 30 years   and over those 30 years  i have had countless men and women who have come to me in situations of decisions that had to be made regarding family members  and in the privacy of a home or in a waiting room  we have dealt with those decisions   tonight  i want to talk about the shame of this debate   the shame of this debate is that in spite of the fact that we are a great leg,0
mr speaker  while i was at home this weekend  my little 2yearold girl wanted me to take her for a walk   i looked forward to having some `` daddy time  with her   but before we could leave  she fell asleep on our stairway   i picked her up  cradled her  and brought her to her bed   as i looked at her precious little face  i thought of terri schiavo s mother and father  how they must have cradled their little girl  loved her  watched her grow  given her hand in marriage   but,1
mr speaker  tonight we are taking on one of the great moral issues of our day  our basic sanctity of life  our right to life  and what you hear tonight is a lot of emotion   we have all had experiences with situations similar to this  or we know those that have dealt with these tough issues   we know family members that have dealt with these tough issues of endoflife decisions   and tonight we as a body are wrestling with this issue   just like america is  we are wrestling with this,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of this bill tonight with a heavy heart  as is everybody in this chamber   i would  though  like to address an important issue that we have not talked much about  and that is the conflict of interest that i believe her husband has with respect to his decisions that are supposedly in her best interest   i have spent a professional career as a cpa working under a code of conduct that requires me to function without conflicts of interest   i have to disqualify,1
mr speaker  the gentleman made a statement  if i understand correctly  that passage of this proposal before us today would translate into a savings of  400 for each family in america   ,0
if the gentleman will yield further  the  400 would actually go back to the american family   is that what the chairman is suggesting   ,0

mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding   we do not know at this point  and we will certainly advise the gentleman when we have that   the problem is because of this shortened week  we have committees that are marking up next week that had planned to mark up this week  and we have to try to work out the schedule so that we can make it as convenient for those markups as possible   ,1
that is correct   the gentleman is correct   ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding   i am not advised as to when we could go to conference on the budget  possibly next week   i know the house is yet to appoint the conferees  so we have a ways to go before a conference report is completed   ,1

mr speaker  if the gentleman would yield  the gentleman is correct  and we are all concerned about the higher gas prices and as important as that is to higher prices of oil and gas   we have been trying to pass or get to the president an energy bill for almost 5 years or 6 years   we have an excellent chance of actually getting a bill to the president this year   we have had three committees scheduled to mark up components of the energy bill this week  the committee on energy and commerc,1
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  the chairman of the committee on the judiciary is absolutely right   we reported out a modified closed rule that provided the gentleman from north dakota  mr pomeroy   an opportunity to not only offer his substitute  but he could have offered a motion to recommit   so two bites at the apple   the exact same opportunity existed on this bill which has gone through congress after congress with an excess of 300 votes in the past   we said a substitute would,1
mr speaker  that is absolutely right   if you look at the cost that exists today because of abuse of bankruptcy law  the abusive filings of bankruptcy  there is  on average  for a family of four of  400 per year   ,1
if i could reclaim my time  what i am suggesting is that because of abuse of bankruptcy filings that take place today  that is a cost that is imposed on american consumers to the average family of four of in excess of  400   that is the reason it is absolutely essential  mr speaker  that we pass this legislation   ,1
i have yielded three times   if i could finish my statement  i would like to   we have other people who would like to participate   i know that my dear friend from florida  mr hastings   will be more than happy to yield further time to the gentleman from massachusetts   mr speaker  we have been waiting for years and years and years to get to the point where we could get a measure to the desk of the president of the united states so that he can sign it  so that we can deal with this is,1
mr speaker  i rise to oppose this legislation   after 4 years of record deficits and  2 trillion in new debt  one would think that the republican majority would have a better understanding of what bankruptcy is   they are lucky this law does not apply to their actions in the last 4 years   instead  we have a bill that promotes one bankruptcy code for the wealthy and another for the middle class   case in point  the bill preserves the `` millionaires loophole   used by the wealthy to,0

mr speaker  i recall yesterday when the death tax repeal was on the floor   it was a similar rule  and the minority was offered a chance to offer a substitute   they offered a substitute which was voted on and debated in the house of representatives   but that rule passed by voice vote   so the rule under which we considered the death tax repeal yesterday is the same type of rule that we are considering today  except that the minority on this bill decided not to offer a constructive alte,1

mr speaker  reclaiming my time  i thank again the gentleman for his thoughtful remarks   we see it differently  mr leader   what we have created is the ability of both sides to stop investigations in their tracks   both sides   our side  if we block up  and our five say you are not going to investigate steny hoyer  they can do it   formerly they could not do that   and i believe your analogy is not apt  and i want to tell you why i think so  mr leader   the investigation is the,0
i certainly will yield to the leader  but before i do  do you see my point  mr leader   either one of us could protect ourselves   either one of us  your side could protect yourselves by your five holding firm   our side could protect ourselves by holding firm   that may protect us individually  but our position is it does not protect the institution  and that is what our concern is   ,0

mr leader  we obviously have a disagreement in the perceptions as to what the rule does and does not do   i think both you and i are very concerned about the reputation and integrity of this house   i think you share that view and i share that view   it is my suggestion that resolving this in a way that is bipartisan will be productive for the house   mr hefley  the former chairman  i do not agree with mr hefley  on a lot of things  but i do agree with his perception of how we protect,0
reclaiming my time  i think we both agree on that   the gentleman from maryland  mr cardin   wanted to say something  but i wanted to say you were right on the process   i was incorrect on the process   it was a separate vote on a separate package  and you are right that i and the gentleman from maryland  mr cardin   and others voted against it   it was not on these provisions as you know because a change was made  not in a partisan sense  according to the gentleman from maryland ,0
reclaiming my time  mr leader  i thank you for taking the time   i know you did not have to  and you have been considerate of this discussion because you and i know it is an important discussion   because it is an important discussion  i would hope that we could move forward to try to get us off this impasse that we have for whatever reasons   and whatever is right or wrong  it needs to be resolved   there are two suggestions here of how to resolve it   there may be other ways to reso,0
mr speaker  i heard the previous speaker s comment   this is not a bipartisan bill   that does not mean that some democrats will not vote for it  but none of the ranking members were involved in this policy  and they are not voting for it   mr speaker  the united states of america needs an energy strategy that not only reduces our nation s dependence on foreign sources of oil  but also strengthens our national security   as a bipartisan group of 26 national security officials  incl,0
madam chairman  the best way that i can characterize this bill is that it is a jurassic park bill in that it is about dinosaurs  of dinosaurs  and in a sense by dinosaurs   it depends on the hope that somehow dead dinosaurs will appear underneath the continent of the united states where they just do not exist   we consume 25 percent of the oil  we have only 3 percent of the world s oil reserves   if you drill in mt   ranier national park  the arctic and yosemite  the oil is not there ,0
madam chairman  the gentleman from alaska  mr young   asked a very important question  where are the technologies that we can use to avoid having to destroy the character of one of our most pristine areas in america   and the answer is that we have technologies today that we simply stopped using 20 years ago   if you look at this graph  it shows the mileage of our cars that we have   you see  starting in 1975 it went up dramatically because we had a bipartisan consensus to demand to us,0
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i appreciate the comments of the gentleman from texas  mr barton     we can not measure contribution by number  we have to measure by weight   however  mr chairman  i think you are still going to win the debate   by the way  i am a new member of the commerce committee   i want to thank the gentleman from texas  mr barton    the chairman  for the very fairminded way that he handled this in committee  in giving both sid,0
mr chairman  i thank the ranking member and the chairman of the subcommittee for their work on this bill   this is hard work   this particular appropriations bill goes to the very heart of many of our congressional districts   i appreciate very much the  47 billion in funding provided to the army corps of engineers  but let me express my disappointment that we have not been able to stretch the dollars to provide work on new projects   i am speaking particularly about sims bayou  greens,1

mr chairman  i am concerned this bill will not clear the budget responsibility   hr 6 technically does not violate the budget act because it is an unreported bill  and budget act points of order generally only apply to reported bills   the bill generally is inconsistent with the 302  a  allocations for both the 2005 and housepassed 2006 budget resolutions   section 2053 of the bill does  however  create a new entitlement program outside the budget window  specifically  fy 2016  ,0
madam chairman  i have the greatest respect for the gentleman from alaska  mr young    and i simply have a difference of opinion with him on this despite that great respect   in what has become a congressional ritual  the prospect of drilling in the arctic has been repeatedly struck down in recognition of the fact that american working families do not want it   still  we have proponents telling us that drilling is good for jobs   some of the nation s largest unions  i might point out,0
mr chairman  i rise today in opposition to hr 6  the energy policy act   i believe every member in this chamber agrees that our country faces a potential energy crisis if we do not act quickly to establish a new national energy policy   we need to make major investments in energy selfreliance  infrastructure  and new technologies   however  where we differ is on how best to achieve those goals   when i look at the provisions of this bill  i do not see a clear vision for america s ,0
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr chairman  i just want to  first of all  express what an honor and privilege it is to work on a subcommittee that works in such a bipartisan way with the great leadership of the chairman and the ranking member   it is really a pleasure to actually get into policy discussions rather than a lot of the politics that we hear around here   it is very much appreciated   also  the tremendous staff that we have on this subcommittee   i think ,1

madam chairman  if ever there was a time when this country needed a smart  forwardlooking energy strategy  this is it   energy prices throughout the country are close to record highs   consumers in my state are struggling with soaring gasoline costs   the price of gasoline in michigan today is 36 cents a gallon higher than it was just 1 year ago   steep increases in the price of natural gas have resulted in skyrocketing increases in consumers  home heating bills over the past few winter,0
mr speaker  i appreciate my appropriations colleague yielding me a moment just to say that my colleague  the gentleman from wisconsin  mr obey    and i have spent a lot of time together discussing these questions and the schedule and otherwise   the relationship is extremely positive  and i believe he and i this week  before the week is out  will have a chance to sit down and talk about 302  b  s  for example   we are going to move forward very expeditiously  and i think it will ,1
mr speaker  we have come to the conclusion  by looking at some recent history  that we can  within pretty close margins  measure what our likely allocations will be   the subcommittees are proceeding as though there are numbers  recognizing full well that we will have to respond to the final budget package as they have given it to us and as we have talked between subcommittee chairmen  but we can pretty well guesstimate   in the past  i believe that we have tended to delay our process,1
madam chairman  i thank the gentleman from california  mr stark   for yielding me time   madam chairman  gas prices are going up every single day  and this bill does nothing to bring down the costs at the pump   in fact  it might just make the problem worse   the energy czars must be the majority leader and company  and they wrote this bill behind closed doors   this bill is immoral   it is a shame and it is a disgrace   this bill was conceived in darkness and born in a den of iniq,0
mr chairman  i rise today in opposition to hr 6   the people of our nation need an energy policy   we need to pass an energy policy that actually brings down record high gas prices  protects our environment  and truly reduces our dependence on foreign oil by encouraging energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources of energy   instead  at a time of record gas prices  this specialinterest  anticonsumer energy bill would actually increase gas prices   the national average price,0
mr chairman  this is truly a bad bill   every day we have pictures on the screen of consumers pulling up to the gas pump  paying an arm and a leg for gasoline   we have 150  000 young men and women over in the middle east protecting our country in that region  and largely as well the oil supplies coming into our country   this bill does nothing in order to deal with that problem   in fact  the department of energy analysis of an almost identical bill in the last congress concluded that,0

mr speaker  i make a point of order   mr speaker  pursuant to section 426 on the congressional budget act of 1974  i make a point of order against consideration of the rule  h res 219   page 1  line 7  through page 2  line 1  of h res 219 states  `` all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived  the rule makes in order hr 6  the energy policy act of 2005  which contains a large unfunded mandate on state and local governments in violation of section 425 ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  back in 1995  my republican colleagues  the socalled champions of states  rights  led the fight to pass the unfunded mandates reform act  a bill they claimed would stop the federal government from imposing the costs of federally mandated programs on states and localities   well  here we are 10 years later and the tables have turned   my republican colleagues are bringing a bill to the floor that imposes a multibill,0
mr speaker  let me respond to my colleague  the gentleman from texas  mr barton    and simply say this is an unfunded mandate   the cbo says so   here is the letter we received yesterday  and it says very clearly that this is an unfunded mandate   i know my colleagues all have great confidence in the cbo   my colleague  the gentleman from texas  mr sessions    made the following statement on cbo just a few months ago   he said  the congressional budget office is a professional,0

mr chairman  i rise in strong opposition to this imbalanced energy bill  which allows big energy companies to exploit our natural resources at the expense of us taxpayers   the bill would repeal the public utilities holding companies act  puhca  which prevents big energy firms  like enron  from driving smaller utilities out of business and monopolizing the energy market   the bill includes a safeharbor provision for mtbe manufacturers even though the chemical has been detected poll,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time  and i rise in strong support of this point of order   simply saying in the legislation that this is not an unfunded mandate does not make the fact that it is not an unfunded mandate   failure to provide the resources by which the directed activity is required under the law is what makes it an unfunded mandate   we have communities throughout california that have had environmental and economic havoc wreaked upon them from the use of mt,0
madam chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   this bill  first and foremost  should be rejected by this congress  because it is very bad for the consumers  it is a very bad deal for the taxpayers  it is lousy for the environment  and it certainly does not do much for the american economy   this bill is another missed opportunity to take america into the future  to take america into the leadership around the world in energy production  energy innovation  and energy,0

mr chairman  as members of this house know  when i have objections to the content of a bill  i am not shy in stating them   there are certainly portions of this bill with which i do not agree  but i want to say that it is very unusual and it is a very pleasant experience to see a piece of legislation brought to the floor which is not so much a product of politics as it is a product of legislative craftsmanship   i think that is the case with this bill   i think that the gentleman from oh,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   i rise to support the rule and the underlying bill   as everyone knows  high energy costs are the greatest drag that we currently have on our economy and actually on world economy  and every year we delay passing this legislation  we become more dependent on foreign oil   i would like to mention very quickly a small part of the energy bill which has to do with ethanol and biodiesel   the bill mandates 5 billion gallons of ethanol ,1

madam chairman  i rise today in support of the energy bill that we are discussing on the floor   madam chairman  the absolute truth is that americans are paying more at the pump today than ever before   home heating costs have escalated dramatically   these things are both reflections of the lack of an energy policy   all we are suggesting in this energy bill is that we need to recognize the dynamic forces that are at play in today s economy  and that we need to take steps to correct it ,1

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for that information   if i could raise one additional issue  it is my understanding that one of the reasons we have not appointed conferees and we have not gone to conference is the issue of the medicaid cuts   i understand a substantial number of members on your side have suggested that those cuts are not advisable   obviously  the senate did not include those cuts   can the majority leader tell me at this point in time if there has been any resolution,0

mr speaker  i think  if one is around here long enough  they get to the point where they do not believe they could be shocked by anything   but when i heard the other side a while ago say that they believe that giving arts and crafts to violent gang members will do more to deter crime than empowering law enforcement agents and locking up gang members in jail  that  i have to admit  still shocks me   mr speaker  i include for the record a letter from the national latino peace officers ,1

mr chairman  this is something that has been discussed since the committee acted and passed the legislation out  but we felt very strongly that this would be a good addition to the legislation because of the fact that so many of these gang members are illegal aliens who have reentered the country after already having been deported and having committed crimes earlier   something needs to be done more than simple deportation when they come right back in and commit more crimes   ,1
mr chairman  i yield myself 30 seconds   mr chairman  the fact of the matter is that this has a great deterrent effect   when the word gets out that they come back into this country and they get arrested after they have been deported and they are going to do serious time in the slammer  they are not as likely to come back   and with the efforts that are ongoing with the real id act  we are going to keep a lot of these people out of the country with that method  and we are going to find,1

mr chairman  i demand a recorded vote   ,1
mr chairman  the gang deterrence and community protection act   hr 1279   is the latest example of congress disregarding its constitutional limitations in the name of `` getting tough on crime  gang crime is certainly a serious issue in many parts of the country   however  unless criminal gangs are engaging in counterfeiting  treason  or piracy  the federal government has no jurisdiction over the criminal activities of gangs   in fact  by creating new federal crimes related to ,0
mr chairman  i rise against this hr 1279  the gang deterrence and community prosecution act of 2005   i strongly believe in cooperation between federal and state law enforcement to deter gang activities   however  this bill takes the wrong approach by imposing mandatory sentences  trying juveniles as adults and expanding the death sentence to new offenses   i  myself  can appreciate the destruction that gang violence can impose on a community   in chicago alone  there are estimated,0
mr chairman  i stand today in strong opposition to hr 1279  the socalled gang deterrence and community protection act   despite its deceptive title  its primary purpose is to punish more young people as adults   this bill would expand the use of the death penalty  treat juveniles as adults and impose mandatory minimum sentences   the research conclusively shows that prosecuting young people as adults does not reduce youth crime   if congress is serious about reducing youth violence ,0
madam chairman  i rise in opposition to the bill  and i yield myself such time as i may consume   madam chairman  it is unfortunate that we are again debating how to reduce juvenile crime and violence   rather than following through on the proven crime and violence prevention techniques that work  we are back to toughtalking sound byte policies that have been proven to not only fail to reduce crime but actually increase crime  waste taxpayers  money and discriminate against minorities ,0
madam chairman  i yield myself 1 minute just to say  first of all  that my distinguished colleague from virginia and i will be working together later this week if they try to close any military bases   but on this bill we  unfortunately  have to disagree   first of all  madam chairman  murder  rape  kidnapping are already illegal in every state   interstate gang members can be caught by rico and organized crime  continuing criminal enterprise  fbi is already working on that   but ,0
madam chairman  i yield myself 30 seconds   if the bill passes or does not pass  it will still be illegal to stab someone 16 times   what we ought to be looking at are the kinds of initiatives that will reduce the chances that that will happen again   giving a 10year mandatory minimum for a second offense fist fight is not going to reduce the chance that someone will be stabbed 16 times when you are not funding any of the programs that are desperately needed to actually reduce juvenile cri,0
madam chairman  i yield myself 1 minute   whether this bill passes or not  murder  rape  robbery will be illegal   people will be prosecuted   they will get time in jail   in fact  as i indicated before  for 15 to 19yearold african americans in this country  one out of eight are already in jail today   this bill  which will try more juveniles as adults  will not only increase the number in jail but will also increase the crime rate   mandatory minimums have been shown to be dis,0

mr chairman  if you kill a police officer you are going to get death or life without parole   if you make any murder in the federal system you are looking at life   if you are talking about the impact of this bill  it is a 10year mandatory minimum for secondoffense fist fights   we have been asked where our compassion is for the victims   we have got mandatory minimums where you already know that it violates common sense  it wastes the taxpayers money  it fails to do anything about re,0
madam chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   madam chairman  i rise in support of hr 1279  the gang deterrence and community protection act of 2005   this bill is a forwardlooking and comprehensive approach to a growing national threat  violent and vicious criminal gangs in our communities   according to the last national youth gang survey  there are now between 750  000 and 850  000 gang members in our country   every city in the country with a population of 250  0,1
madam chairman  i yield myself 30 seconds   madam chairman  i deeply respect the arguments that have been advanced by the gentleman from california  mr schiff     he put forth his proposal in committee  and it was defeated on a rollcall vote of 3 ayes to 22 noes   so the schiff proposal did not even carry a majority of the democratic members in the committee  let alone the republican members   ,1
madam chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   madam chairman  i have been here for a number of years  and when you are against a bill  you can come up with a million and one reasons why the bill should not pass   we just heard some of that  but if we do not do anything  the killings are going to continue   we can have a legitimate disagreement on mandatory minimum sentences  but i think there are some crimes that are so severe and eat away so much at the roots of our soci,1

mr chairman  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr chairman  the opponents of this bill seem to zero in on two things   first of all  they are opposed to mandatory minimum sentences   people may have a philosophical disagreement on mandatory minimum sentences  but it seems to me that given the violence of gang activity  the number of murders  the number of maimings  that a mandatory minimum sentence is absolutely necessary to get these people off the streets if the twelve person,1
mr chairman  the material that is on page 20 relates to a clarification of the ban on possession of hand guns by juveniles   it appears to me that the clarification does not clarify the statute   the best thing to do is to completely remove the clarification as was proposed  thus leaving the current law intact  which means that if a juvenile possesses a hand gun  he will have to have a written note stating that he is authorized to do so from his parent   ,1
mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,1
mr chairman  i rise in support of hr 1279  which will increase the prosecution of gangs and help prevent gangrelated crimes   gang violence is a serious problem  and we need to address it with determination and creativity   a recent rash of gangrelated violence has left four injured and one person dead in the city of norwalk this year   my own home town of bridgeport has faced a tough gang problem for years   it is absolutely essential we have strong legislation on the books to send ,1

madam chairman  i spent 22 years as a judge in texas trying criminal cases  felonies  22  000 felony cases came through my court   they dealt with everything from major theft to capital murder cases   and a lot of those cases were gang cases   and the people in this country who believe and think that gangs are not a problem are sorely mistaken   it was the action operative of the gangs in the houston area to use juveniles to commit serious crimes  violent crimes  because those very juv,1

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  let me first point out to those who may be following this debate why we are here today   i am sure people are wondering why we have a resolution on the floor that would withdraw us from the wto and how that comes to the floor from a recommendation of the committee of jurisdiction that it be reported unfavorably  that is  that we vote against this resolution   the reason we have this resolution before us is that 10 years,0

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  i once again rise to urge my colleagues to reject this resolution   it is important that we work within a rulesbased trading system in order to expand opportunities   only by working within a rulesbased trading system can we raise the international bar on labor standards  on environmental standards   if we were to pull out of the wto  we would have no opportunity to raise at all the labor standards in other countries or ,0

mr speaker  today the house will undoubtedly vote down this resolution and signal strong support for remaining in the world trade organization   this is the right decision to make   it is the right decision to make because the wto  and its predecessor  the gatt  have served as a catalyst to reduce both tariff and nontariff barriers for us exports   since the formation of the gatt  average tariffs in industrialized countries have gone down from 40 to less than 4 percent  since the cr,0

mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   i just want to respond to what i think was an inadvertent misstatement by the gentleman from indiana on what i think is an overthetop provision of this bill  requiring a veto of any new or expanded peacekeeping operations in the security council   he referred to it as an ability for the us to withhold its forces for it   but read the provision you have written  the president shall direct the united states permanent represe,0
mr chairman  would it be fair to say that  in effect  his effort is an effort to gild the lily   ,0
madam speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 319 and ask for its immediate consideration   ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the kindness and flexibility of my good friend from florida   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  i appreciate the opportunity for having had a very quality debate here today   it is interesting to note once again that the ranking member and the chairman have said the need for reform is obvious   there is no disagreement on that point   it is seemingly the mechanism of doing that   once again i point out that in 1985  1994 and 1999  this house set precedent by doing the exact same concept that is there   and it is tr,1
mr speaker  i thank my friend for yielding and also for the cooperation of those on the appropriations bills this week as we move to an early conclusion of this week s work   next monday  the house will convene at 12  30 pm   for morning hour and 2 pm   for legislative business   we will consider several measures under suspension of the rules   a final list of those bills will be sent to members  office by the end of this week   any votes called on those measures that members are g,1
certainly based on the experience we have had for the last three fridays  the cooperation of both the ranking member and the leadership of the chairman and the subcommittee chairmen on the appropriations committee  we have been seeing this work go a little faster than we had anticipated   that could happen again next friday   the experience again of the last three fridays would lead one to believe that  but next week we will adopt the same approach   we will get this work done early if we ,1
mr speaker  i believe we will do those in the order that they appeared starting on tuesday   so i would expect tuesday s work to include the science  commerce  state  justice appropriations act  and then move on to defense appropriations on wednesday if we are completed with the previous bill  and then to bring the bill to the floor on united nations reform after that   ,1
i would say  in response  that  interestingly  the discussion on that bill  it is an important discussion  is largely between the new director of national intelligence and the armed services chairman because of some commitments that seemed to have been made and i think were made during the adoption of the 911 bill of things that would be included in this bill   that discussion is going on   we are going to work hard to do everything we can to facilitate a final and complete understandin,1
mr speaker  if i could comment  i would say that we are eager to reach a final understanding on this   but  also  we are eager to be sure that whatever commitments were made and were reached between the administration and the chairman of a significant committee in the house are fully understood and fully complied with   you know  there can be misunderstandings in these kind of discussions  certainly  but we want to be sure that any commitments made by the administration to the congress,1
i do not know what their position on that is   again  i am most concerned that we be sure that we understood our positions when commitments were made when that bill was passed that created the national intelligence director s position   ,1
i would say it would be hard to be more disappointed than i am that this committee has only met once because of continuing concerns   from the point of view of the majority  i am sure it is our view that we removed what we thought were the obstacles of this committee moving forward with its work  only to find that there is another obstacle   and we do need this committee to work  but all sides need to be looking for ways to make the committee work  not to just find the reasons that the com,1
i appreciate what the whip has said and would only say that we could vote on this and solve it that way  but i assume that would not present the right solution as well   ,1
mr chairman  i rise today in strong support and appreciation really of both of our leaders on this bill  the gentleman from california  mr lantos    and i am particularly pleased to see this bill named in appreciation and recognition of the great leadership of our committee on international relations chairman  the gentleman from illinois  mr hyde     i think we all know on both sides of the aisle that the united nations has not lived up to its expectations   it unfortunately has com,1
mr speaker  first of all  let me echo what has been said about the gentleman from illinois  mr hyde     there has never been a finer member of congress in the history of the republic than the gentleman from illinois   he was one of the most eloquent speakers i have ever known in this house   we really appreciate all his hard work on this bill   now  let me say to my friend from massachusetts  i have been listening to this stuff for 20 years   you can not do anything to put pressure ,1
mr chairman  i just want to say to my colleagues this is a very serious debate  and when one starts using terminology like is he trying to gild the lily  he is trying to protect american servicemen from any kind of legal action that might be taken against them   so let us be serious about it   ,1
mr chairman  how much time remains   ,1
reclaiming my time  mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for his comments   ,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr chairman  i thank the gentleman from california for his leadership and also the gentlewoman from nevada   but i do want to take this time  mr chairman  to recognize the extraordinary leadership of the gentleman from illinois  chairman hyde  of the committee on international relations   the gentleman from illinois is truly a man with a backbone of steel and a heart of gold   he is an icon of this institution  and i  for on,1

mr chairman  i rise with great respect for both the gentleman from illinois  mr hyde   and the gentleman from california  mr lantos   in this   while we can all agree that our country  as the biggest contributor to the un  must help the organization become more efficient and effective  the lantosshays substitute finds a compromise that i think reflects where the majority of americans come down on this issue   the gingrichmitchell task force takes serious issue with much of the d,0
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time  madam speaker  and i rise in strong support of this rule   i think that the underlying legislation is much needed and long overdue   i have been working to help reform the united nations since i first came to congress  and i have not found anybody yet that disagrees with the fact that we very  very direly need to reform the united nations   this onceutopian organization has degenerated into an institution that is largely dysfunctional and ,1
madam chairman  i rise today in strong support of the foreign relations authorization act   chairman hyde along with ranking member lantos crafted a bipartisan bill that was strongly supported by the house international relations committee   i would also like to give my sincerest thanks to all the staff of the committee who have worked so hard to make sure that all the members of this committee had an opportunity to way in on the bill to make improvements that were important to us   the comm,0
madam speaker  i also want to add to the remarks of the gentleman from florida  mr hastings   and our ranking member  the gentleman from california  mr lantos    when it comes to the gentleman from illinois  mr hyde     i have served with the chairman both on the committee on the judiciary and on the committee on international relations   i have profound respect and deep affection for him  but i do not like his bill   it is clear that there is a consensus that the united nations ,0
mr chairman  i think it is important that when we talk about reforming the united nations that we have to be clear about what the united nations is   it is not simply the secretariat   the secretariat is just the staff   they are the hired help   they run the daytoday affairs of the united nations  but it is the member states that set policy  that make decisions that are responsible for oversight in implementation of the united nations resolutions   in particular  it is the function ,0
mr chairman  i thank my friend for yielding me this time   i also read the same report that the gentleman from new jersey referred to  but i would like to provide him an update at this point because i am sure he received his information from a newspaper report  if i am correct   ,0
mr chairman  reclaiming my time  again  let me provide this as an update  because this is a report by the associated press from today  titled `` un   oilforfood author of email memo says he never discussed oilforfood contract bid with kofi annan   the executive who wrote an email suggesting that the un   secretary general kofi annan may have known about a un   contract awarded to his son s company has denied ever discussing the firm s bid with annan  a law firm said wednesd,0
mr chairman  i first want to thank the gentleman from california  mr lantos   for his longstanding leadership on issues related to the united nations and human freedom   no one has greater respect for him in this body than i do   but in this case  mr chairman  i think and i believe that the lantos substitute just falls a little short   six decades ago  the united nations was formed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ,1
i thank the gentleman for yielding   and i would just like to congratulate him for the emphasis that he has had on the education aspect of this  along with training  as a very important part of our effort here   he has helped us modify the language in the measure and he represents the navy postgraduate school very  very well   and we look forward to seeing the success of this program due in large part to his efforts   ,1
madam chairman  may i inquire how much time is remaining   ,1
mr chairman  the un   soon to celerate its 60th anniversary  is chartered to promote universal human rights  justice and social progress   these are perfect ideals that the global community must strive to put into action  but that does not mean the un   is a perfect organization   recent scandals and the lack of transparency within the un   undermine the essential role the un   plays in world affairs   reform is an urgent priority but the cure for fixing these problems should not,0

i received it from different locations  actually   it began  if i may  it began with newspaper reports   ,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume  and i just want to say that i appreciate both gentlemen s comments and the information that they conveyed   ,1
madam speaker  i yield myself 7 minutes  and i thank the gentleman from utah  mr bishop   for yielding me the time   let me quote  this would undermine american credibility at the united nations   it would undermine our effectiveness   those are the words of the distinguished under secretary of state nicholas burns  who said of the bill that we are considering  it will call into question our reliability as the founder and host nation and leading contributor to the united nations and w,0
i thank the chairman  and i agree with him regarding our rhetoric   when i made my references i was referring to the bush administration and not to the distinguished chairman and other members in the body   and i stand by those statements  mr chairman   ,0

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  i want to join in wholehearted endorsement in echoing of all of the words of praise that have been directed toward the distinguished chairman of the committee on international relations   i have known the gentleman from illinois  chairman hyde  to not only be gentlemanly and eloquent  but fairminded and bipartisan in a substantial number of efforts  and i  like all of our colleagues here  deeply appreciate the work tha,0
mr speaker  i take this time for the purpose of inquiring of the majority whip the schedule for the week to come   ,0
i thank the gentleman for that information   first  if the distinguished whip knows  my presumption is  based upon the schedule that has been submitted  that the probability is we will not have votes on friday next   is that a reasonable assumption  do you think  for our members to make   ,0
mr speaker  can the gentleman tell us  with respect to the appropriations bills  which day of the week  tuesday and thereafter  you might expect each of the individual bills to come up in particular   of course  the defense appropriations bill is of great interest to our members   ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for that information   i note  mr whip  that the intelligence authorization bill  which was schedule to be on the floor today  which had been pulled  is not on the schedule for next week   that obviously is a very important bill   and it is  i would say to my friend  as i understand it  a bill which has the agreement between the chairman of the intelligence committee and the ranking democrat on the intelligence committee   so it would seem to be a,0
mr speaker  i thank the whip for the information   it may be helpful to know that i believe on our side of the aisle  we believe that the gentleman from michigan  mr hoekstra   and the gentlewoman from california  ms harman s  agreement was appropriate in the sense that the flexibility be given to the national intelligence director to provide for the best possible personnel assignment with reference to maintaining our security and intelligence apparatus in the most effective mode woul,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for that information   i will ask one more question on the intelligence issue   does the gentleman know whether the administration is supportive of the position taken by the chairman of the intelligence committee and the ranking democrat on the intelligence committee or not   has the administration taken a position on that   ,0
reclaiming my time  i thank the gentleman   lastly  we just had a vote on the privileged resolution that was offered by the democratic leader  the gentlewoman from california  ms pelosi     that resolution  as you know  sought to try to move the ethics process forward so the ethics committee could do its work   hopefully  all of us believe that it is very important that the ethics committee be able to undertake its work   i would hope that the majority would take steps to perhaps di,0
reclaiming my time  i thank the gentleman  and i have no doubt about his sincerity in that desire   i would simply observe that had we had the opportunity to debate the privileged resolution  which really seeks to redress the house s positions  that perhaps we could have explored more broadly the differences that exist as they relate to the staffing of the committee   both sides apparently believe that they are correct in their interpretation  but hopefully both sides want a bipartisan a,0
i think the gentleman is probably correct  and of course the resolution offered did not resolve the question   we understand that   but i think the gentleman is correct  it would not resolve it any more than the vote on the rules in january resolved the changing of the rules and the feeling that they were not appropriate to provide the context in which we could proceed   i know that the gentleman from missouri  mr blunt   very honestly and sincerely  as i do  wants to see this matter r,0
madam speaker  i want to respond to my friend from florida that the language that substitutes for debate around here is troublesome   demagogic  i heard the gentleman say   immoral  gunboat diplomacy  contempt for the un   none of those inflammatory terms  in my judgment  apply to this debate   and i suggest that we can disagree as to the one issue  and that is how to enforce the reforms we all agree are needed  without calling each other names or disparaging our motives   ,1

mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr chairman  i would like to announce that i am terribly flattered by the extravagant things that have been said  but i must confess i did not name this bill after myself   while i deeply appreciate the honor  i am a trifle embarrassed  not thoroughly embarrassed  but a trifle   mr chairman  most informed people agree that the un   is in desperate need of reform   corruption is rampant  as evidenced by the everexpanding o,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i just want to respond to my dear friend  and he is my dear friend   if i ever become president of the united states  i would nominate the gentleman from california  mr lantos   as my secretary of state and be guided by his advice   ,1
mr chairman  that is what i think of the gentleman from california  mr lantos     mr chairman  i just want to point out that substantial compliance is accorded to the secretary of state  so if 38 of the 39 are complied with  the 39th could have been substantially complied with and suffice   ,1
mr chairman  i ask unanimous consent that i be allowed to claim the time in opposition   ,1
mr chairman  the gentleman from california  mr lantos   has just administered the perfumed icepick   ,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i would like to state improvement is our goal  too   a healthy un  rather than a vast  sprawling  bureaucratic cesspool which is where it is headed   everyone agrees to that   now this notion that we are obliged by the treaty to pay our dues and that it would be an international default if we did not  that was argued before back in the 1980s   contributions to the un   are made subject to authorization and appropriation of ,1
madam chairman  i just want to say to my good friend that it is not on automatic pilot   there are 3 years over which there is time to comply  the un   can comply   so that is a pretty slow automatic   ,1
mr chairman  i rise to oppose the united nations reform act of 2005 as it is currently constituted   this legislation sends the signal to the world that our nation has a disdain for the united nations and i for one can not support that idea   there are many instances in which the un   has been instrumental in furthering us foreign policy objectives   in the past year alone  the un   helped organize parliamentary elections in iraq  reconstruction efforts following the indian ocean ts,0

mr chairman  i thank the chairman   ,1
mr chairman  reclaiming my time  i would agree with the gentleman   in my remarks  i particularly did not direct my remarks to the secretary general  and  in fact  the remarks are directed to our ambassador to the united nations  that in the future he continue that policy   ,1
mr chairman  i demand a recorded vote   ,1
mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding to me   this is extremely wellcrafted legislation that the chairman has brought forward in close cooperation with many of his colleagues on the committee on international relations  and i am in very strong support of this bill   there is language in section 4 which calls for a uniform code of conduct  which i think is a very excellent idea   we want to be very certain that as this legislation goes forward  it in no way can be misinterprete,1
mr chairman  we are trying to make sure that there is no possibility for misinterpretation as we bring forward this very important new legislation  and that it can in no way subject the american armed forces or any other american personnel  for that matter  to foreign tribunals or the international criminal court   ,1
mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding to me   i just want to be very brief   ,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume  and i thank the gentleman from indiana for his comments   i want to be very clear that i am in strong support of this legislation that has come forward by the committee on international relations  but there are things that raise my interest and my concern   a few weeks ago media outlets throughout the world proudly parroted amnesty international s unfounded charges of torture and ill treatment in the socalled america `` gulags  i,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr chairman  before yielding  let me commend the gentleman from california  mr rohrabacher   for his powerful statement   and let me commend the gentleman from illinois  chairman hyde  for including in his bill extremely important measures that enhance accountability   i would like to state that the lantosshays substitute which we will present later contains the same measures   we are in full accord on dramatically enhancing,0
mr chairman  i thank the gentleman from california  mr rohrabacher   for his comments   ,0
mr chairman  i have the greatest respect for the gentleman from indiana  mr pence     the problem with this provision  as with much of the bill  is the lack of judgment that our secretary of state could bring to bear as a new  tragic darfurlike situation erupts someplace   we do not question the need for improving the peacekeeping process  we are with you totally on that  but we would like to have our secretary of state have the opportunity of exercising her judgment in a rapidly ch,0

mr chairman  i just heard the gentleman advocating for flexibility for our secretary of state   does this flexibility extend to the bill as a whole  in the gentleman s view   ,0
mr chairman  i want to commend my good friend from florida for an improved version of the underlying hyde bill   i refer to the hyde bill as a guillotine on autopilot  and i think it is in the true american spirit that the gentleman now has a more effective  fasterworking  more suicidal guillotine which he is offering to this body   i do not think this proposal deserves really any serious comment   if  in fact  38 12 of the 39 hyde commandments are fulfilled  we should not automatic,0
i thank the chairman for yielding to me   mr chairman  this is yet another occasion that chairman hyde and i stand shoulder to shoulder on attempting to reform the united nations   i strongly concur with the chairman  this is overkill   it is overoverkill   using the gentleman s logic  it is difficult to see why he is not proposing a 95 percent automatic dues cutoff   but maybe upon reflection he might propose that on a future occasion   ,0

madam chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i briefly would like to respond to both of my good friends   we are not offering a resolution   our legislation is identical to the republican legislation   the only difference is that your punitive provision is automatic  our punitive provision provides discretion to the secretary of state to implement it or not   so please do not talk about resolutions   we are not talking about toothless resolutions   our legislation is as b,0

mr chairman  as so ably demonstrated by the gentlemen from california  mr lantos  and mr rohrabacher   the un   is crying out for reform   but let us not forget that the only oath we as members take is to the constitution and votes should reflect this obligation  not pique  not ideology  not wellintentioned concern for reform   unfortunately  the approach contained in the bill before us contravenes the united nations charter and undercuts the rule of law   it also misreads the c,0
mr chairman  let me say i may consider the lantosshays alternative imperfect  but it represents a credible political balancing and is clearly preferable to the underlying bill   but listening to the debate over the past 2 days  i sense a lack of perspective not only for treaty obligations but for the un   itself   corruption exists in all societies   it is rife  indeed endemic  in some   at the un  it is isolated  it is not endemic   i have known hundreds and hundreds of people,0
mr chairman  i thank the ranking member for yielding the time  and i want to express my enormous respect for the gentleman from illinois  mr hyde    my dear friend  with whom i agree on some things but not on this issue  although the majority of the bill i know is consistent with the gentleman from california s  mr lantos   and my view  although i do rise in strong support of the lantos substitute and in opposition to the underlying bill  but it is with great respect  and i appre,0

mr chairman  how much time is remaining   ,0
mr chairman  it is time that we make real reforms at the united nations that address the real problems  but i believe that the hyde bill simply sets the united nations up to fail by creating a series of requirements that will be almost impossible to meet   one might even argue that this is the actual goal of some un   critics   the united nations is governed by 191 countries  including syria  iran  and north korea  who would have to approve the majority of these changes   this seems ,0

mr chairman  let me just note that what measures that we have been suggesting in the bill  as you have just underscored  are very reasonable  and the fact that we have bipartisan support on the measures demanding accountability suggest that these are things that the united nations should not be opposing   this is nothing that should raise the fur up on the back of the necks of any official at the united nations   so i appreciate the gentleman  and also  all those ladies and gentlemen on,1
mr chairman  this has been a fine debate today  and i believe that both sides have handled it very responsibly  but let us take a look at what the real issue is   there is broad agreement on both sides as to the need for reform in the united nations   this is not in contention   there is even broad agreement of what changes need to be made  what are the issues at the united nations  a lack of accountability and some of these monstrous atrocities that we have seen  and the inefficiency ,1

mr chairman  just by way of clarification  i appreciate the gentleman s comments  and budgets are difficult  there is no doubt about it  and they say where we are in the priorities   just by way of clarification  this fund is not for the talented and gifted program   this fund is to find high quality teachers and reward high quality teachers who increase achievement in schools and increase achievement in closing that gap   ,1

mr speaker  today we consider house resolution 559  the rule allowing consideration of the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2006 labor hhs education appropriations bill   this legislation is the clearest demonstration of the contempt for the proper functioning of this body and ultimately disrespect for democracy   the labor hhs education appropriations bill is an incredibly important piece of legislation   it determines funding levels for job training programs  community col,1

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise in strong support of this resolution  and i am proud to be one of the original cosponsors   i would like to point out a couple of problems with the proposed transaction   number one  if unocal was trying to buy the chinese national offshore oil company  they could not do it  because chinese law does not allow a foreign company to have a controlling interest in a company in china   that is one problem   ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentlewoman s courtesy in permitting me to speak on this bill   there are a number of things in here that i have no objection to  that i think we should do in terms of preserving our national security   but what is striking about h res 344 is that it basically misses the point   it is inadequate   it talks about only a little bit of the equation   the problem that we have now is first  we have a reckless fiscal policy in this country aided and abetted by ,0
mr speaker  this is a good resolution  and i support it  and the issue is important   however  i just wanted to stand tonight to point out the fact that we are really just talking about the tail   this is not the dog  it is simply the tail   it is important   i do not want to minimize it   but the truth is we are talking a  16 billion sale most of which will go to american shareholders   however  what we are not talking about is the elephant in the room where right now as of today ,1

mr speaker  i had hoped to come to the well to speak on a bipartisan resolution   given the preceding remarks from the well  it may be difficult for international observers to detect the bipartisanship   rather than succumb to the temptation of snappy rejoinders in the field of domestic political debate  rather than use this time as a pretext for a campaign screed that would criticize the opposing party instead of deal with the resolution at hand  rather than rephrase history about troubl,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   i support the attempt to block this sale   this sale involves a strategic asset and  more importantly  a strategic lever for communist china   our policy for the last many years has been to deter the chinese government in beijing from ever coming into the position where they thought they had enough leverage over the us to cross the straits of taiwan   this would be a major lever that would accumulate to the chinese communist,1

mr speaker  i rise today speak in opposition to hr 741  a bill to amend the occupational safety and health act of 1970 by requiring judges in osha appeals cases to give more weight to the commission s decisions than to labor department regulators   supporters argue the legislation would codify the intent of the 1970 occupational safety and health act  pl 91596    however  i would argue that the measure would violate a 1991 supreme court ruling that gave the labor department priority ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this opportunity and take great privilege in coming to the floor today to place into the public realm a concern that is deepseated in the city of toledo and the state of ohio which i am so honored to represent   it in fact deals with corporate manslaughter   i stand today to oppose any weakening of osha statutes  and support the owens bill to strengthen worker safety and protection   for  in fact  if those protections had been in place ,0
mr speaker  i would like to start by saying that neither this bill nor the other three weaken osha   we designed these bills to help osha   part of the problem is that this 34yearold bill has been changed by activist judges  it has not been reviewed or looked at in 34 years in any sense  and these simply bring fairness back into the equation   as you can imagine  34 years ago  we had an osha bill that was drawn up by a democratic house and a democratic senate that was very fair  just,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i want to make my comments on this bill very briefly   essentially  hr 741 weakens the fundamental policy of the secretary of labor while enhancing the powers of the osha commission   such action would create two divided regulators and a great deal of confusion   the secretary of labor is best able to regulate and enforce safety standards  and as such  the authority should remain with her   this is just plain common sense   i u,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  the critical question is what more important things should we be doing   this commission bill which creates confusion  to our knowledge  is still not sanctioned by the administration or the secretary of labor   why are we putting such great amounts of time and energy into proposing new powers for this commission when there are other more important things that we ought to be addressing   and the statement by the gentlew,0

mr speaker  i rise in opposition to hr 741   instead of working to strengthen osha standards  my republican colleagues have presented yet another piece of legislation aimed to weaken it by undermining the clout of the secretary of labor   the secretary of labor should be the final authority on how osha law is interpreted  and this bill undermines the secretary s authority    giving the commission too much latitude   the secretary of labor needs an unbiased group of peers during th,0

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   it has been a long 4 hours on four bills   we stayed on the subject for about 2 hours   these four bills are very important  i believe  for the small business community in the country   i realize that the labor union kingpins do not like these four bills  but i promise labor union workers who are out there in small businesses will like these bills   there have been some outlandish statements that need to be corrected for the record  ,1
madam speaker  we are here again   we went through this marathon a year ago   we have had several sets of hearings and markups on these four bills  and one would think they are very important   they are important  but in the reverse way   they are not important to protect the health and safety of working families in america   they are important because they are trying to trivialize the whole safety component of the department of labor and the whole safety responsibility of the government,0
madam speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   hr 739 specifically creates a legal loophole for bypassing the obligation on an employer s part to meet a 15day deadline for contesting osha citations   as such  the bill promotes increased litigation   given that the osha commission already has the authority to review any missed deadlines on a casebycase basis  such litigation is completely unnecessary   that bears repeating   at present  the osha commission relies on its,0

mr speaker  my legal career of 25 years was to represent small business owners   and since coming to congress 3 years ago  i have worked consistently to make it easier for small businesses to grow and succeed in our country   i appreciate the leadership of the chairman  the gentleman from ohio  mr boehner    and my nextdoor neighbor  the gentleman from georgia  mr norwood    for their promotion of small businesses   however  osha regulations placed upon our small businesses con,1
madam speaker  i rise in opposition to hr 739 because it appears to be just another way for this administration to distract from the real priorities of our nation s workers  fair wages  open labor negotiations  secure pensions  us jobs over the outsourcing of our jobs and  of course  a safe working environment that protects workers from harm and allows their families peace of mind   yet with this legislation  we put the company s bottom line above the safety of american workers  ,0
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to hr 740 because workers deserve to know that their interests will be heard without biased judgment by the occupational safety and health review commission   grieving families across america depend on osha to stand up for them and for their deceased and injured loved ones   but this legislation will threaten one of the only hopes that families have for justice when a loved one is harmed at work   by increasing the membership of the commission from three t,0
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to hr 742 because workers deserve to know their interests will be represented fairly by osha  not weighed by how much money it will cost to bring the claim forward   we all have small businesses in our districts  and we all know that it saves money to provide for a safe workplace in the first place and preventing accidents   workers and their families suffer due to poor safety at some workplaces   they have enough angst because they ca nt count on their,0
mr speaker  i once again want to commend the gentleman from georgia  mr norwood   for his wonderful and excellent work in the area of worker safety and his real concern for making certain that the rules under which we ask businesses and employees to work are workable   we are all interested in workplace safety   we have got to get that on the table as often as possible   we are all interested in workplace safety   now  the gentleman from california  mr george miller   made some very,1
mr speaker  i have come down on these four bills and i have come for a variety of reasons  but one main reason is to make those corrections that are so necessary with the arguments on the other side   we have heard  why can we not have investigations   why can we not consider another bill   why can we not do this or that   well  these are all interesting questions but they have nothing to do with this bill   the hyperbole from the opposition has been remarkable   the contention  they,1
madam speaker  i want to thank the gentleman from ohio  mr boehner   for his leadership in the committee on education and the workforce and the fact that he has been able to pass reasonable legislation that not only helps the employee but the employer and gives us a better business atmosphere in this country   i would also like to thank my friend and fellow georgian  mr norwood   for his leadership in finetuning our occupational safety and health laws   the gentleman from georgia has w,1
madam speaker  i am proud to support and cosponsor all four of these important pieces of legislation on osha reform   each is an integral step to come to the aid of our small businesses   not only are our small businesses increasingly faced with greater competition from the bigger competitors in the us but also are they faced with greater competition from across the globe   the last thing they need are unnecessary and burdensome regulations from their own government   according to a study,1
mr speaker  i rise today in support of hr 525  the small business health fairness act of 2005   in 2003  there were an estimated 45 million americans without health insurance   small businesses employ over 60 percent of those currently uninsured   without question  cost is often the biggest barrier to affordable health insurance for small businesses   too often  i hear from small businesses owners back in my district in missouri that the affordability of health insurance is their num,1
mr speaker  today there is a point of agreements and a strong point of disagreement   there is a point of agreement that health care costs are rising too fast for too many people   there is a point of agreement that the consequences of that price increase is a tremendous burden on small business and a high likelihood that more people will be uninsured   i do not think there is a member of this body that does not favor finding an intelligent and effective way to reduce health care costs for ,0
mr speaker  among those who know the difference between a cadillac and a lemon are the insurance commissioners of our states who oppose this bill   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  the argument for this bill rests upon a false choice that i believe would have catastrophic consequences for many americans   we are told by proponents of the bill that if we are willing to yield the guarantees that they presently enjoy under the law that guarantee them a mammogram  guarantee them care for diabetic illness  guarantee them other rights that they fought and won for  if we make that tradeoff  we will get mor,0
mr speaker  i thank my friend  the gentleman from wisconsin  mr kind    for yielding me the time   i think the best way to understand the difference between the plan that the gentleman from wisconsin  mr kind   and i are putting forward and the majority plan is to look at it from the point of view of one of the small business people that we keep hearing referred to over and over again here today   my friend  the gentleman from wisconsin  mr obey    often refers to speeches on th,0

mr speaker  i rise in opposition of hr 525 and the association health plans it creates   there are 44 million americans who are uninsured in this country and this bill will not even affect 1 percent of them   not 1 percent   cbo found that only 360  000 uninsured americans would join ahps   this bill in fact hurts those who enroll in the plans and will even cause healthcare costs to go up for many other americans   there has to be a better way to help 44 million uninsured americans   ,0
mr speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 379 and ask for its immediate consideration   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i must admit that much of the opposition gloomanddoom predictions are based on assumptions of what people and companies will choose to do and  therefore  the government should make those mandates   i am pleased that this particular piece of legislation is based on the assumption that people have the ability to make good choices for themselves without the assistance of the heavy hand of government   ,1
mr speaker  increasingly  one of the things i hear from small business owners back in tennessee is they want congress to open the way  just to open the way and set the stage for more affordable health care choices   over 90 percent of the jobs in tennessee are small business jobs   it is the largest employer in my district   mr speaker  one of the things that we hear is that these employers want to do the best they can for their employees   they feel like they are a part of their famil,1
mr speaker  it is unfortunate that while we are in the midst of a healthcare crisis for the uninsured  for small businesses  and for practitioners  congress is recycling the same flawed legislation   the proposal would allow association health plans to bypass the state solvency framework requirements  leaving the consumers at a significant risk   the reason that over 1  350 business  labor  and community organizations oppose hr 525  including organizations such as the national gov,0
mr speaker  uninsured working families are looking to congress for answers to help give them access to quality health care  and before us today is a bipartisan bill that should give them hope   the economic picture remains bright  and more americans are finding work every day   earlier this month  the department of labor reported that 37 million new jobs have been created since may of 2003  marking 25 consecutive months of positive job growth for the us economy   unfortunately  ther,1
mr speaker  pursuant to h res 379  i call up the bill  hr 525  to amend title i of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 to improve access and choice for entrepreneurs with small businesses with respect to medical care for their employees  and ask for its immediate consideration   ,1
mr speaker  i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 525   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  the most pressing crisis we face in health care today is the number of americans who lack basic health insurance   the number of uninsured americans today stands at 45 million americans  27 million are fully employed   and 63 percent of these working uninsured are either selfemployed or work for a small business with fewer than 100 employees   it is tragic that so many employers can not afford to purchase highquality ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself 30 seconds   mr speaker  the gentleman from georgia and i have had a disagreement over this particular provision for several years   it is very clear in the bill  as i read it  not the way the gentleman from georgia  mr norwood   reads it  and this is where the source of the disagreement comes in terms of how plans can choose groups of employees   under current erisa law  you are allowed to have different rates for different groups of employees as long as,1
mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  small employers today have a difficult problem   they are trying to keep their business alive   they are trying to make enough money to hire and grow their business and at the same time trying to provide affordable health insurance   about 60 percent of the 45 million people who have no health insurance work for small businesses of some sort   but what happens to those small employers in most of these state risk pools   th,1
mr speaker  i thank my colleague for yielding me this time to speak on the substitute that has been offered   now  if we think that having states regulate insurance in a small group market is a problem with statemandated benefits  this is the mother of all complicated programs to offer health insurance  because what are we going to do   we are going to have the federal government do it   now  none of us really believes that the federal government ought to be in the business of running ,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the gentleman s motion   ,1
mr speaker  the most coveted health insurance available to americans is offered by big companies and unions   all we are trying to do in the underlying bill is to give small employers the same opportunity to provide highquality health insurance to their employees at competitive prices   the motion to recommit would require every ahp to cover every mandate known to man  driving up the cost of those policies and making sure that no new employees would ever be covered by an ahp   there are 4,1
mr speaker  i thank my friend and colleague on the committee on rules  the gentleman from utah  mr bishop    for yielding me this time  and i rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation  the small business health fairness act   mr speaker  a trip to the doctor should not bust the family budget   too many of america s small business employees go without health insurance or pay a big chunk of their paycheck for health care   this house has acted on four separate,1
mr speaker  i oppose the underlying bill for many reasons   fundamentally  it violates the concept of federalism that is embodied in our constitution  respect for our states  and the ability of our states to be able to regulate public safety issues and health issues for the people of our states   this legislation would preempt the ability of my state and your state to protect the rights of our own citizens through regulation   that is wrong   that is the wrong usurpation of power by the,0
mr speaker  i think the rules committee has made a terrible mistake here  and not the usual rules committee sort of mistake  because they have actually allowed to come to the floor a substitute that is so clearly superior to the ahp bill it is amazing   now  let my friends on the other side understand  i am not against ahps   i am an original cosponsor of the gentleman from texas  mr johnson s  legislation   ahps would be an improvement over current market conditions  which are app,1
mr speaker  i rise today to urge a `` no  vote on hr 525 and a `` yes  vote on the kindandrews substitute   this debate is  frankly  misdirected   the question is not who recognizes that there is a health care crisis in this country and who does not   this is not a contest to see who among us truly understands that small businesses are finding themselves in an increasingly difficult predicament when it comes to providing health care insurance for their employees   we all care abou,0
mr speaker  i appreciate my friend yielding to me   mr speaker  the house will convene on monday at 12  30 pm   for morning hour and 2 pm   for legislative business   we will consider several measures under suspension of the rules   a final list of those bills will be sent to members  offices by the end of the day   any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6  30 pm   on tuesday and the balance of the week  the house will consider additional legislation under susp,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding   there is no way that we can tell what hour of the day on friday that we might be finished with our work   as the gentleman knows  next week is going to be a typical predistrict work period week   we have several bills to consider  as well as multiple potential conference reports   because of the unpredictability of conference reports  i would hesitate to even make firm commitments for any of the week   for now  i would note that our p,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding   as i said earlier  it is very difficult   certainly we will consult with the minority as to timing   for instance  right now we think we will have a highway conference report   there may be an energy conference report   there could be one to three appropriations conference reports   it is very difficult today to fashion a schedule that we could give to the members   i feel very confident by monday we will have a better feel for what the,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding   i can not say that   i really do not have any idea   i know it will be after tuesday  and that is about the best i can give the gentleman   ,1
i thank the gentleman for yielding   yes  we plan to present the postal reform bill on tuesday   we think we can do both that and the small business health plan on tuesday   ,1
it is possible that interior  legislative branch  and homeland security conference reports could be presented by next week   ,1
we could bring them to the floor by next week   ,1
if the gentleman will continue to yield  no  we did not list that bill as of yet   there are still discussions going on about that bill  and until those discussions are concluded  we can not predict when it will come to the floor   ,1
i appreciate the gentleman yielding   it is possible it could be added to the calendar  but looking at how busy a week we have next week and the controversial issues that we will be bringing to the floor of the house  it is hard to say if we could put that bill on the floor next week   ,1
i appreciate the gentleman yielding   we will try our best  in consultation with you  to give you some idea of when we could possibly bring that bill  and if it is going to be considered next week and we can fit into the schedule  then certainly we would let you know by probably the end of business monday   ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate my friend yielding   i am very encouraged   i serve on the conference committee  so i am very encouraged by the accomplishments and progress that has been made over the course of this week   i believe there is really only one major issue left to be resolved by the conferees  and that relates to transit funding   hopefully  that can be resolved prior to the wednesday night expiration of the current shortterm funding measure  and then  as normal  there are a l,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding   everyone is working as hard as they can   as the gentleman knows  this bill has taken a long time to work out the differences between the house and the senate   we get very close every time we reach the deadline of an expiration date   the expiration date is set on wednesday   everybody is going to be working over the weekend  and we are working as hard as we can with the goal to bring that conference report to the floor before the expir,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding   we are working on it   we hope to get it done by the end of next week   it is a very ambitious goal  i must say  to take a bill of this magnitude and  in a matter of 2 weeks  get all the differences worked out between the house and the senate and bring it to the floor   this is another item that the house and senate are working on through the weekend  and at least encouragement has been brought to my attention by the chairman of the co,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding   we have not made any decisions yet  but obviously the gentleman knows and members understand that the appropriations process did end with us passing our bills before the july 4 break   the senate is working on appropriations bills  and we will be doing those conferences as they present themselves   also  we do know that at least the first week back  we could be looking at the coast guard authorization bill and possibly a research bill fr,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding   the campaign finance committees are still working on those issues   it is quite possible that we could address those issues in september   the way that i am watching the schedule of the other body  we will probably be here at least a week or two after october 1  and we would be working on those issues   i have every expectation that the committee on ways and means will put out a retirement security bill for us to consider in september or ,1
mr speaker  the socalled small business health fairness act is anything but fair   congress should not be in the business of promoting the reduction of healthcare benefits and coverage and that is exactly what this bill does   proponents of hr 525 argue that health insurance will be cheaper under this bill  but the devil is in the details   healthy people would enjoy low premiums under association health plans because the plans are exempt from state consumer protections and minimum qual,0
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise today in strong support of h res 379 and the underlying bill  hr 525  the small business health fairness act of 2005   my good friend  the gentleman from new jersey  just spoke about some mandates regarding ob care and  of course  there are mandates that have been passed in the several states  all 50  in fact  that are very compassionate sounding   the gentleman from new jersey is right   many of us have  as,1
mr speaker  today i rise in strong support of the rule for hr 525  the small business health fairness act of 2005  offered by the gentleman from texas  mr sam johnson    mr speaker  if we do not act soon  america will face a health care crisis   health care costs are skyrocketing   we all know it  and  unfortunately  so do the ranks of america s uninsured   as usual  government is part of the problem   more freedom and more competition is part of the solution   with nearly,1
mr speaker  today member after member has been talking about the 45 million americans who lack health insurance   at the origin of our problem  we are the only major country where your health care coverage depends on who you work for   but that is not to be debated today   we are talking about the small businesses in new jersey and elsewhere around the country that face the high cost of health insurance   we all hear about it from our small businesses and their employees   unfortunately ,0
mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to the small business health fairness act  hr 525   this bill would not only fail to expand health coverage for the uninsured  but would actually reduce health care benefits and coverage for 8 million individuals who would be switched to lower benefit ahp health plans   only 1 percent  600  000 people  of the 45 million uninsured americans would be provided new coverage by ahps   instead of providing broader access to comprehensive heal,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for that information   realizing that next week is a busy week and there are a number of very important items on the agenda  how likely  mr leader  do you think it is that we will be in on friday   ,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  thank you for that information  mr leader   mr leader  obviously next week i suppose the most controversial and most focusedupon piece of legislation will be the central american free trade agreement   this week  of course  the patriot act  which we thought was going to start thursday and go through today  in fact was accelerated and nasa was taken today  clearly to ensure full consideration of the patriot act   might it be possible with some assur,0
mr speaker  i thank the leader for that response   i understand the problem of pinning down now exact times   would it be fair  however  mr leader  to say that it would not be considered on the last day we are here  on friday  or not  so that we could make sure that members knew and had some degree of confidence  because it is such an important piece of legislation  that it would not be considered on the last day we are here   ,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  the postal accountability bill  you seem to indicate that that might be considered earlier in the week rather than later   is that accurate   ,0
mr speaker  i thank the leader   reclaiming my time  you mentioned appropriations bills   are we likely to have motions to go to conference on appropriations bills next week  and if so  can you anticipate what bills that might be   ,0
those conferences would be on the floor  is that what the gentleman is saying  possibly   ,0
in terms of motions to go to conference  do you anticipate motions to go to conference on any appropriations bills next week   ,0
i appreciate that   on the bill of the gentleman from arizona  mr shadegg    i think it is hr 2355  dealing with the insurance issues  there is a lot of interest on our side of the aisle   will that bill be considered   did you list that as one of the health bills that would be considered   ,0
reclaiming my time  mr leader  i take it that in light of the fact you have not mentioned it  at this point in time it is not on the schedule   but there is a lot of discussion on this side of the aisle about that bill   do you think it would be possible that it might be added to the calendar   ,0
because there is so much interest in that bill on our side  mr leader  would it be fair to say that that decision would be made prior to the close of business on monday so that we would have some notice of that in time to fairly consider it   ,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  we would appreciate that   the other bills that i would like to talk about  the highway bill conference report the gentleman indicated as a possibility  can the gentleman inform us of the status of that conference and where we are on this bill   ,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  i presume  am i correct  that the gentleman s effort would be to try to pass it prior to the expiration of the last temporary extension  or would the gentleman anticipate another  which i guess would be the tenth or the eleventh extension  or does the gentleman think he can perhaps get it through prior to wednesday night   ,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  i thank the leader for his comments and observations   we are certainly hopeful on our side  and i know the gentleman is on his side  that we get this bill through   it is probably as significant a jobs creation bill as we will pass in this congress  and it has been delayed for a very long period of time   i know the gentleman has been frustrated by it  and we have been frustrated by it  and hopefully  we can get that done by next week   the energy bi,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  in light of the fact  mr leader  i will simply observe that if we get all of those things moving we are going to have a lot of work to do next week  and i presume our members ought to be prepared for long days and  clearly  if we get all of that done  it will be friday late before we get out of here   in light of the fact we will not have a colloquy next week because we will be going on recess for the summer work period  can the gentleman tell us what ,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  i thank the gentleman for that information   lastly  there are two pieces of legislation  major pieces of legislation that the gentleman did not mention but have been talked about  and that is  of course  the social security legislation and the campaign finance legislation  one or the other bill  or both   can the gentleman give me his thoughts on where they stand and when they might come on the agenda if  in fact  they will be coming on the agenda ,0

mr speaker  i rise today in support of hr 525   this bill  introduced by the employeremployee relations subcommittee chairman sam johnson  committee chairman john boehner  small business committee ranking member nydia velazquez and albert wynn  would allow small businesses to join together through association health plans  ahps  to purchase health insurance for their workers at a lower cost   the measure would increase small businesses  bargaining power with health care providers ,1
mr speaker  i am pleased to be here today to support the rule to govern hr 525  the small business health fairness act of 2005   as costs continue to escalate annually at unprecedented rates  our employers are being forced to drop health care coverage  or not be able to afford it at all   our small businesses share a large part of that burden because they are forced to shop for health insurance in the costly small group market   large employers bring bargaining clout to the table when ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from ohio for yielding me this time   as you know  mr speaker  the cost of providing health care for employees has become the number one issue for small businesses around this country   it is especially important to me  because in my home state of texas  one in four workers are uninsured   small businesses have it especially tough because there is an inherent problem in a small number of people   you need to be able to pool risk to make insurance work,1
mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,1
mr speaker  we have heard it over and over again today on the floor   too many working americans have a job  but are uninsured because their employers can not afford to purchase quality health insurance benefits for their workers   this bill addresses the two most important issues in the health care reform debate  cost and access   hr 525 would  one  increase small businesses  bargaining power with health care providers  two  give them muchneeded freedom from costly statemandated,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  as the number of uninsured americans continues to increase and health insurance costs continue to rise by double digits annually  it is clear that something must be done   i commend our friends across the aisle for coming up with a plan they think works   while i have great respect for the gentleman from new jersey  ranking member andrews  and the gentleman from wisconsin  mr kind    i have to disagree with them  ,1

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   as we all know  we are in a health care crisis and many propose many solutions   but let us just find out the simple facts   facts are  insurance ratings are really dependent on the notion that some people are higher risk than others   those are the people that insurance companies love to insure   they love to insure them because if they have low risk  every dollar that they pay in terms of premium is another dollar down on their,0
mr speaker  i want to commend my friend and colleague  the gentleman from new jersey  mr andrews    for the leadership he has shown on this issue   here we are again  mr speaker   year after year after year it seems we continue to rise in this chamber to debate the same issue   one of the reasons we have to do this year after year is because bad policy is tough to sell  and especially tough to sell in the senate right now  which has refused to take this up and move it forward becau,0

mr speaker  i yield myself 1 minute to respond quickly  just to clarify a couple of facts   mr speaker  i have all of the respect and admiration for the chair of our committee  but a closer reading of the substitute bill would not  in fact  require a federalrun program  rather the department of labor would contract out the statelicensed health insurance plans in order to administer these programs   but we do feel that there is a requirement or a necessity to offer greater incentives,0
mr speaker  i just recommend to the previous speaker that he should talk to any federal employee with regard to the choices that they are offered under the federal employee health plan   ,0
mr speaker  how much time remains   ,0
we are waiting to get a cost estimate back  but based on two previous debates on this issue  it was comparable to the amount of money set aside for the health savings account that has been a part of this bill in the past  but is not this year   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  i think there is wide agreement  bipartisan agreement that we have got a serious issue on our hands  a huge challenge that is facing our nation  that is  rising health care costs and the impact it is having on economic growth  the opportunities for businesses large and small to grow and hire additional workers   i think it is one of the main reasons why we have experienced such anemic job growth in this country in recent ,0

mr speaker  as we worked on this on the committee on education and the workforce  we tried to put our thoughts into it   people have to understand  if the main bill is passed  health care for our small employers is not going to help the majority of those employees seeking coverage   the recommittal goes back to what the states have already done  mainly because in the beginning the insurance companies would not give health care to women that needed to have a mammogram or to have a pap sme,0

mr speaker  i rise in support of the small business health fairness act  hr 525  which will allow small businesses and associations to band together to purchase health insurance coverage for their workers and their families   the small business health fairness act can directly benefit the over 2  300 small businesses and associations in my congressional district and their employees   hr 525 would allow ahps and small businesses to be certified under one federal law  instead of 50 dif,1
mr speaker  i thank the chairman very much for yielding me this time   mr speaker  it is my understanding that hr 525 is supposed to decrease the cost of health insurance for small businesses that can not afford it today   well  i support that   that is a good goal   all of us support that   yet  unfortunately  i believe that in this bill that has been undermined a little bit  and my logic is fairly simple   as i read it  in section 805 of the bill  it allows an ahp to preempt ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate this opportunity to speak on behalf of the rule and the underlying legislation   mr speaker  i would like to just mention a personal story   i have a soninlaw who manages 150 stores   they are part of a franchise and are spread across 40 different states   if they have to purchase health care store by store  it is prohibitively expensive   their costs are going up 10 to 20 percent a year   one of the previous speakers said it may not add a whole lot of peopl,1
i thank the gentleman for yielding time   mr speaker  let us understand something fundamental here   people do not just want the appearance of health insurance   they want a program that they can trust and that will pay when they incur the claim  and that is the critical problem with the bill being put before us   there are no meaningful consumer safeguards   this can manifest itself in three critical ways   first  as to content   we all know about insurance loopholes  the fine print,0
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to hr 525  the small business health fairness act  but in strong support of meaningful measures to help small businesses offer affordable  quality health care coverage to their employees   for many businesses in my congressional district and across the country  the rising cost of health insurance is a growing crisis   currently  many small businesses devote significant resources to offer health insurance to their employees  money they could have othe,0
mr speaker  i rise today in support of the kindandrews substitute and in strong opposition to hr 525  the small business health fairness act of 2005   we have the opportunity to give small business owners and employees meaningful access to affordable and comprehensive coverage by adopting the kindandrews substitute   or  by passing hr 525  we can give access to cheap  flimsy insurance policies that will not provide meaningful protection and leave those who need better coverage far ,0
mr speaker  i rise in support of hr 525  the small business health fairness act   this legislation would allow small businesses to pool their resources into what are known as association health plans  ahps  to purchase health insurance   pooled alliances  including ahps  help control health care costs by permitting individuals to use their collective bargaining power to win cost concessions from insurance companies   these alliances also achieve economies of scale for administrative ,1
mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to hr 525  the regurgitated association health plan  ahp  bill   this is the fourth vote on this exact same legislation in as many years   so  if my statement sounds familiar  that s because it has all been said before   while they ve titled the bill the small business health fairness act  its impact would be the opposite   this bill would have the perverse effect of increasing the cost of health insurance for many people and increase,0
mr speaker  this socalled small business health fairness act is a bill that is attractive to a few  seems to be sufficient for none  and is going to be harmful for many   the congressional budget office did an estimate of the proposed bill   it estimated that only 600  000 of the 45 million uninsured will be provided new insurance coverage by these ahps   in fact  the respected 2003 mercer consultant study that was done for the national small business association found that the number ,0
mr speaker  in every state and every district when we meet with small business owners  their number one concern is rising health care costs   even as we sit here  the cost of health care continues to rise   today s legislation will help address this problem   association health plans will provide an employerbased solution to help the sector of the economy that is being hit the hardest  small businesses   critics of the bill will come forward today and tell you how association health p,1
mr speaker  an issue i often hear about from my constituents is concern about the high cost of health insurance and the need for affordable insurance coverage   we all know health insurance premiums continue to increase substantially each year   as such  many small businesses are unable to afford health insurance for their employees   furthermore  for those who can afford insurance for their employees  rising costs make us products more expensive  harming us competitiveness and cost,1
mr speaker  the preemption of state law that is allowed under hr 525 makes no sense   for example  49 states guarantee that health insurance plans include mammograms  and for good reason   we know that if a woman has health insurance  the likelihood she will receive a mammogram is promising   we know that early detection increases a woman s chance of surviving breast cancer   no one knows this better than my constituents in marin county  california  who suffer from the highest rate,0
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise in strong support of hr 525  the small business health fairness act  designed to allow small businesses to create large insurance pools in order to give them market power which will allow them to purchase quality health insurance at affordable prices through association health plans   in truth  our biggest bipartisan failure in this congress has been our inability to help 45 million  now pushing 50 million  americans,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his work on this issue and so many other important issues   when i go home  and especially as a physician in congress  when i go home and talk to small businesses  they say whatever you do  whatever you do  do something about my health care costs   make it so i can help my employees get insurance   mr speaker  45 million uninsured we have heard  60 percent or more of those are employed currently  and why do they no,1

i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  first of all  i have respect for our insurance commissioners  but i want to say that three out of the last four in louisiana went to jail   so that is no automatic protection   i think other states have had similar problems   the preemption language in the bill only grants two limited exceptions from state laws that regulate insurance   fully insured ahps are exempted from state laws that would  one  preclude them from esta,1

mr speaker  i know the gentleman s intent is honorable   i am not questioning that   can the gentleman answer questions about section 191  the strategic refinery reserve   i know the gentleman from virginia  mr boucher   is the prime author   ,1
first of all  it says the secretary shall establish and operate   does that mean that the federal government would actually build these refineries and operate them with federal employees   ,1
would these refineries operate continuously  around the clock  or would they only operate when the president has declared an energy emergency   ,1
well  on page 18  the implementation plan just says the secretary shall transmit to the congress a plan   but it is your understanding that if this were to become law  these refineries that would be built by the department of energy would actually be operated on a continual basis  is that correct   ,1
but the strategic petroleum reserve is a reserve that you take crude oil and store it so if we need it you bring it up and transmit it to refineries to be refined into refined products   a strategic refinery reserve  as i understand it in this bill  you actually go out and build the refineries  and it is unclear to me whether you would operate them around the clock or just in some sort of an emergency   i do understand that you require the secretary of energy to transmit the plan   but if ,1

mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman s comments  the speaker before me  because what he has really laid out is sort of the complaints that we hear from the democrat side of the aisle  the complaints for years when they controlled congress and laid out policies and rules and regulations that prevented  really  people to bring capital at risk to build refineries   so we hear a lot of complaints  but we do not hear of ideas and actions to help an industry that will help america   this ,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this illconceived legislation   this bill is a shameless attempt to use the tragedy of katrina as an engine to drive bad policies into law   the purported reason behind the bill is the high cost of gas caused by katrina  and this is the bill that is supposed to meet that challenge   but gas prices were at record highs before katrina hit   katrina merely ramped them up and provided an excuse to push more failed republican energy ideas   i guess ,0

mr speaker  one of the things that you can say about the way in which the national republican party has handled america s energy problem is that they are being very consistent  and that goes back to the first moment when they controlled both the congress and the white house  when the president  charged by the bush administration to develop an energy policy  did the natural thing for them  brought in the energy companies to tell them what kind of policy we should have   that attitude is ,0

mr chairman  as you know  the high energy costs are having a very negative effect on the low income home energy assistance program  and many state liheap programs are expecting a major increase in applications and need for additional funding immediately to help ensure lowincome families and seniors can afford to heat their homes   i recently joined with more than 100 of my colleagues in writing to the committee on appropriations members requesting  1276 billion in additional liheap fundi,1
mr speaker  parliamentary inquiry   ,0
mr speaker  is the discretion of the chair or the abuse of the discretion of the chair and the abuse of power subject to a vote of the house to continue this vote open   because we have a history on this house floor of illegalities taking place to change people s vote   is the discretion of the chair and an abuse of the discretion of the chair subject to a ruling and a vote by this house   ,0
mr speaker  we find ourselves with so many things happening now   we have increased gasoline prices  increased winter heating costs  natural gas prices are up  manufacturing jobs are down  all because the cost of energy has remained high   our demand for oil has grown  our production simply can not meet demands  and this has caused increased prices   we have increased population  and we want more manufacturers to remain in the united states   that means that we have to do something ,1
is the gentleman sure about that   ,0
the gentleman looks good   ,0
mr speaker  the gentleman is absolutely right   the amazing thing to me when i was listening to the republicans in the last hour is when they were trying to make the analogy to their households and talking about their kids   and one of the republican members talked about how he went down to the candy store and you could only spend what was in your pocket  and that is what we want to do here   and i was saying  these guys on the republican side of the aisle have been building up deficits e,0
i know the gentleman says he is older than me and i question that   i know i have been here longer than he   i remember when i first came down in 1988  there were a group of republicans who would come down and do special orders every night  and they had the pages come out with this digital clock that really was the length of this dais here  and every night they would talk about the deficit and how they wanted to cut the deficit and the deficit was climbing too high   that is just all compl,0
i wanted to respond to one thing the gentleman said because he took us back to the clinton administration and the last 2 or 3 years when we had a surplus   not only did we have a surplus because we had a balanced budget but the economy was booming   jobs were being created left and right   i do not care if you were rich or you were poor  things were getting better   but president bush comes in and he is elected and he says  the answer to the economy is we are going to cut taxes   and the ,0
mr speaker  i wanted to say one thing  and then i want to lead into the issue of this budget reconciliation that we want to talk about tonight   i wanted to go back to what my colleague from massachusetts said about how  since the bush administration came into office  the fiscal policy benefits wealthy people and is at the expense of the middle class   there is no question that is true   i would venture to say that the republican fiscal policy is really stupid for everyone because the bo,0
mr speaker  i could not help but remember within a few days of the hurricane when president bush gave a speech  i think from new orleans  and he talked about how they were going to reconstruct the city and provide all of these programs and benefits  and none of it has happened   it sounded like he was doing a reconstruction program like in iraq  or the marshall plan after world war ii   now they are proposing cuts in all of the programs that would actually benefit people   it is not jus,0
the gentleman from ohio  mr ryan   talked about prevention before in the context of health care   it is not just iraq versus america  it is the fact that these cuts are plain stupid   we talk about prevention in terms of health care  by eliminating community health centers  people go to emergency centers  and it costs more   an argument could be made if we did not cut funding for the levees in louisiana  we may not even have had the crisis there   ,0
mr speaker  the budget bill that they want us to vote on  the one we were supposed to vote on last week  cuts funding for levees again  not necessarily the one in new orleans  but other levees in louisiana   this is part of the funding cuts   they want to cut levee construction now   this is not the same one that fell in new orleans   ,0
mr speaker  i used this analogy last week  and i can not help but repeating it again   soon after the invasion of iraq  the us invasion  a couple of our republican colleagues went over there   maybe it was within 6 months of the us invasion   it was in september of the year after   they had just come back  the republican colleagues had just come back from iraq  and they had been there on the first day of school   i will never forget because i was on the floor waiting to do a spec,0
mr speaker  if the gentleman will continue to yield  one of the things that the 30something group has been talking about  and it relates directly to what he said  is this idea that there should be a bipartisan commission in the aftermath of hurricane katrina   and it is the same principle that the gentleman from massachusetts brought up  that they just do not want any kind of investigation of themselves   the republicans control the white house  the senate  the house of representative,0
mr speaker  i thank the distinguished gentleman from michigan for yielding   i commend the gentleman from michigan for his great leadership  and i thank him for his great leadership on behalf of the american consumer and the american taxpayer   the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman from virginia with their very wise substitute give a chance to help the consumer and declare energy independence   i also want to commend the gentleman from michigan  mr dingell    the distinguished ,0
mr speaker  my parliamentary inquiry is  is it not bringing dishonor to the house of representatives for this body to act in the shameful way that it is   is it not part of the culture of corruption of the republican party to dishonor the wishes of the american people   ,0
i have a parliamentary inquiry   mr thomas  during the vote    parliamentary inquiry  mr speaker   based upon the statement of the gentleman from maryland that everyone had voted and that therefore the vote should have been closed   ,0
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the stupak substitute and in support of the underlying legislation   i want to thank the gentleman from texas  mr barton    the chairman of the committee  my friend  for his leadership   we have seen this year that we have passed comprehensive energy legislation  but that legislation did not address really the linchpin of the need in our country for greater refining capacity and greater pipeline security  redundancy and reliability   katrina expos,1
mr speaker  i am a little surprised by the discourse from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  very 1960s rhetoric for a 2005 problem   you can not regulate and put hurdles and tell the oil industry that is really global these days that you can not build refining capacity in america   it is bad   most americans  when they saw the hurricane strike  realized that 30 percent of our refineries were at risk  30 percent   they understood that you can not concentrate our refineries i,1
mr speaker  i thank the chairman for putting this bill together   i want to talk about one very important provision of this bill  and i want to endorse the passage of this legislation   this legislation builds on progress we had in the energy bill dealing with boutique fuels  but what i want to do is explain the problem we have with boutique gasoline blends in america   today we have 18 different fuel types  which translates into 45 different fuel blends   this map of america looks like,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the opportunity to address the house again   unfortunately  we are missing a couple of our standardbearers who are usually here  our two members from florida  the gentleman from florida  mr meek   and the gentlewoman from florida  ms wasserman schultz   who are down dealing with the hurricane and the storm down in florida   so we want to send out to them our thoughts and our prayers   we are thinking about them and their constituents and all the citizens ,0
we are going to have to implement the same rule that we had to implement when the gentleman from new jersey  mr pallone   came   the gentleman is going to have to pay dues twice to the 30something group   ,0
i agree with the gentleman 100 percent   the study that the gentleman just referenced  the economic policy institute  the 30something group is all about thirdparty validators   this is not the meek or ryan or delahunt or pallone institute   this is the economic policy group  a nonpartisan economic study group saying that the tax cuts were bogus   a couple of our friends on the other side said  well  the projected budget is going to be  100 billion or  80 billion less than what they ,0
mr speaker  if the gentleman would yield briefly  i just want to share a thirdparty validator that we have as we continue talking about welfare in the united states and what it is being spent on   this is by cal thomas  who writes a column   cal thomas  as most of you may know  is one of the conservative columnists in the country   in his column this week  he says  `` seventytwo percent of farm subsidy money goes to 10 percent of recipients  the richest farmers  partnerships  cor,0
mr speaker  if the gentleman will yield  i just want to make a point   the money that is getting cut  and we understand that reform needs to take place and our friends on the other side have not been willing to do it  but to cut  94 million in community health care and community health centers  that is preventative medicine   that investment is ultimately going to save our country money and save our health care system money because those people who will not have access to the community ,0
basically what we are trying to say is that the republican majority in the house and the senate are not only spending american  hardworking taxpayer dollars to subsidize the most profitable industries in the country  the oil industry  the pharmaceutical industry and the top agricultural  the megafarms   not only are they doing that  welfare for corporations  and democrats are for ending corporate welfare   not only have they provided a welfare state for iraq where we are not going to lo,0
and tuition is going to double in 5 years   ,0
mr speaker  how about this for shortsightedness   we are going to cut the centers for disease control   everybody is talking about the avian flu   we do not know what to do   people are making requests of the administration   i am sorry  but government is the problem  unless somebody needs something   and i am sorry  but the republican majority has had this house since 1994   they have had the senate since 2000 or 2001  definitely since 2002  and on and off through the 1990s  and,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  the decisions that we need to make have to be focused on what is best for the country  not what is best for one s political party  and i think that has really been the problem   it seems to me that every decision that is made down here by the republican majority is what is best for the republican party  not what is best for the country   and it is time we start choosing the country over the party if we want to have some success   and just go through ever,0
how long was this vote for   ,0

and how many minutes have elapsed   how many minutes have elapsed since the vote was called   ,0
fourteen for a 5minute vote   i thank the chair   mr markey  during the vote    mr speaker  parliamentary inquiry   ,0
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this bill and in support of the stupakboucher substitute   this bill does nothing to help us gain energy independence  to increase refining capacity  or lower prices at the pump   and no member  and particularly no one who represents the midwest  should vote for this bill   the federal energy information agency predicted that the price of natural gas would increase by 71 percent in the midwest this winter   in chicago  the average heating bi,0
mr speaker  1976 was a great year   we built our last refinery in this country  and i graduated from high school   that is too long for that to occur   our domestic demand for crude oil averages 21 million barrels a day   we refine only 17 million barrels a day   that means we import gasoline   people understand we have a dependence upon foreign oil   what they do not understand and find incredibly ridiculous is that we import refined product just making us more dependent on the indust,1
mr speaker  i would like to address my friends and colleagues   we have got a lot of good members on the committee on energy and commerce  and i have great respect for my friends  the gentleman from michigan  mr stupak   and the gentleman from virginia  mr boucher    who come here with serious public policy concerns   i want to speak on an issue they do not address  in fact  i think they roll back  which i think is critical to addressing the price spike  and that is boutique fue,1
mr speaker  the gasoline for america s security act has a nice name  but it does little to help missouri s farmers and rural commuters who are experiencing record high energy costs   motorists in missouri and across the nation are paying a premium for gasoline and diesel fuel  especially in the wake of severe weather in the gulf of mexico   missouri s fourth congressional district is primarily rural  and residents rely heavily on transportation in going about their daily lives   this ,0

mr speaker  the gentleman from pennsylvania makes a good point  but if you look at today s washington post  `` natural gas danger signs   they talk about a 90 percent increase in natural gas   higher costs threaten our economic growth in us manufacturing   here is usa today  `` staying warm costs up 90 percent more  there is no way you are going to vote for the barton bill  the main bill  if you believe the price of natural gas is too high   if you believe everything the gentl,0
mr speaker  when the oil refineries raise their rates 255 percent in the last 12 months  that is unconscionably excessive   ,0
well  mr speaker  if the gentleman will continue to yield  i guess we are going to have to look in the bill  because in the bill we also put in there factors to be considered excessively too much   if you go to the bottom of page 2  bottom of page 3  we put it in there   our bill says that in 90 days the ftc has to define it for us   ,0
i will give the gentleman examples   i think excessive is more than reasonable   when it is more than reasonable pricing   ,0
a great example is georgia   why did it go up  6 a gallon after hurricane katrina   was that reasonable  when the rest of the nation was about  3   that is excessive   that is unconscionable   ,0
then the president  much like the manager s bill  and much like excessive  and the gentleman s bill has the same language basically because you copied our bill  so you can go outside the area   the president has the authority to go outside the area  just like he does in the underlying area   and getting back to the ftc and what is excessive  again just like your bill  you used different words  but you allow the ftc to define it   we gave more than you gave   we actually gave concre,0
in answer to the gentleman s last question  if you look at page 4  we have rulemaking in there  where the ftc shall promulgate the rules necessary and appropriate to enforce   under the rulemaking process  you  myself  just about all of us have an opportunity to put in our two cents  worth on what we feel may be excessive  market manipulation  or price gouging   so  again  if you want to dwell on a word or two  i think all americans know when they are being excessively gouged at t,0
go ahead   i will try to answer it   ,0
it is just like the strategic petroleum reserve  it is up to the secretary to approve it   would the federal government and federal employees operate it   no   much like we did in the energy bill for nuclear   let us put it up and build it  but let someone else operate it and manage it   ,0
they would operate around the clock   mr chairman  if you look on page 18 on how it would be implemented  it is starting on line 9  we have the implementation plan  and it must be established within 2 years and how they are going to do it   but we would operate it yearround   the refined product would go to  without an energy declaration by the president  refined product would go to the military to meet their military needs   at times of emergency  then we would shift to give relief,0
`` shall transmit the plan to congress for establishment and operation of the strategic refinery reserve   lines 11 and 12   again  he will submit his plan  whoever the secretary is   they may have a different idea  but they must submit it to the congress so we can see   it is just like spr  subject to appropriation  subject to congressional oversight   ,0
mr speaker  i yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from california  ms pelosi    our democratic leader  who has been so supportive in our efforts to make sure that americans get a fair shake at the gas pump and when they heat their homes this winter and go to work each and every day   she has been there fighting for the american people   ,0
mr speaker  i demand a recorded vote   ,0
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this bill today   this socalled gas act has nothing to do with bringing the prices of gasoline down  its ostensible purpose  and everything to do with the republican leadership overreaching  exploiting the catastrophes of hurricanes katrina and rita to their own advantage   as i said earlier this year when the house passed the energy policy act  there is nothing i d rather vote for than a balanced energy bill that sets us on a forwardlookin,0
mr speaker  what have members been hearing in their districts   i will tell members what i have been hearing  there is a constant uproar and anguish about the gas prices across this country   one of the home builders that i met with earlier this week  it cost him  94 to fill up his pickup   sadly  i do not see that price going down any time soon   this is a longterm  not a shortterm  problem   worldwide  we consume what we produce   this country uses 25 percent of the world s e,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to hr 3893  which in many ways is little more than a hastily assembled  and opportunistically revived  retread of discarded ideas from past energy debates   mr speaker  our constituents are asking for transparency in markets and price relief at the pump   so what does this bill do   rather than empowering the ftc to launch an aggressive investigation into recent reports of market manipulation  this legislation actually reduces the maximum pe,0
mr chairman  i rise in strong opposition to hr 3893 and in strong support of the stupak substitute   the gulf coast of the united states was devastated by a catastrophic hurricane   hundreds of thousands of americans lost their homes and their possessions   gasoline prices jumped 46 cents per gallon overnight   price gouging was rampant   the big oil companies charged more  simply because they could   the oil companies took shameless advantage of the disaster  and now washington repu,0
i do have an inquiry   ,0
when there is a markup without members having more than a day to review it  when the bill is rewritten and put on the house floor without members having had a chance to review it  when the vote is held open a long period of time after the time has expired  does that not make the house a banana republic   ,0
after the votes have been cast  is it not appropriate to announce the votes   ,0
mr speaker  one of the things that bothered me at the time of katrina and then rita was when you saw on the television long lines of cars at gas stations that were charging  5 or  6 for gas that you knew they did not pay that much to get in there   i do not believe that disasters should be a windfall for opportunists  and i appreciate the chairman and his staff working with us over the last week to strengthen the pricegouging provisions in this bill   currently  under current law  most,1
mr speaker  times of tragedy should not be windfalls for opportunists in the wake of hurricane katrina gas prices fluctuated to upwards of  600 in some communities   prosecution for price gouging is generally a state matter unless it involves some form of collusion or other activity in violation of federal laws   only 23 states have antigouging laws on the books  and definitions vary widely   only 13 of those states have emergency antigouging laws   the aftermath of hurricane katrina ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this bill  the socalled gasoline for america s security act   now  this is not a partisan rant   i am a democrat  but i supported the last energy bill   it had considerable merit and a few flaws   this bill is very flawed and has very little merit   let us talk about refineries   over the past 20 years  us demand has increased 20 percent   no new refineries have been built,0
mr speaker  since the 1973 energy crisis  we are no more energy independent now than we were then  and this legislation will do nothing to resolve this nation s bankrupt energy policy   for those of you who support federalism  this measure goes in opposition to state rights   our current energy policy is bankrupt   if this congress is to pass a real energy policy  here are some things what we must do  open up anwr  invest the revenue into renewable energy resources  and provide ince,0

mr speaker  i want to address a serious problem with the underlying bill  and that is that it relies exclusively on the federal trade commission and its willingness and ability and resources to enforce the price gouging remedy in the bill   i think we should all remember this is the same ftc that said  we do not have any authority to investigate price gouging in this area  we do not need any authority in this area   everything is just fine  thank you very much  and then  when pressed f,0
mr speaker  i rise today in vigorous support of hr 3893   this bill takes us back to earth in reality   this bill recognizes the need for increased supplies of refined petroleum products and takes the necessary steps to increase refining capacity   no new refinery has been constructed in the united states since 1976   we just heard the numbers earlier   the demand for gasoline exceeds domestic production by an average of 4 million barrels per day   this growing gap is met by importing ,1
mr speaker  there is no doubt that the entire nation is paying a price for the astronomical costs of oil and gasoline  and  mr speaker  pennsylvanians are no exception   just yesterday  philadelphia residents were told that their home heating bills would increase by 194 percent   that comes on top of doubledigit price increases that they had to absorb last year  and it means they will pay on average an additional  335 to heat their homes this winter   winter can be very cold in pen,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman from new york for yielding me this time   i rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill  hr 3893   hurricane katrina highlighted the failure of the republican leadership s first attempt to create a national energy policy   we now have a second chance to craft a forwardlooking strategic plan   unfortunately  hr 3893 fails to do this   instead of tackling america s very serious energy challenges  we are looking at the castaside,0

mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   the gentleman is talking about various kinds of supplements   he mentioned ephedra and other supplements to help people lose weight   that is a substantial distinction here   if a person buys a supplement and there has been misleading advertising or the manufacturer knows of adverse effects and does not communicate those  and if that constitutes a violation of law  a lawsuit is not prohibited by this legislation   this legislation,1

also  it is related to  my understanding is yet so many other aspects come from this that you may find in such children also eating disorders and diabetes and cancer risks even if that child never themselves smoked cigarettes   but the risks are huge   i believe a direct and indirect medical cost of smoking in this nation is about  138 billion per year   of course  another reason why i believe it is so important not only for the government but really for individuals and businesses to focu,1

mr chairman  congress is once again using abusive litigation at the state level as a justification nationalizing tort law   in this case  the personal responsibility in food consumption act  hr 554  usurps state jurisdiction over lawsuits related to obesity against food manufacturers   of course  i share the outrage at the obesity lawsuits   the idea that a fast food restaurant should be held legally liable because some of its customers over indulged in the restaurant s products  an,0
madam chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   madam chairman  in addition to the violation of principles of federalism outlined by my colleague from north carolina  this piece of legislation is another piece in which we are taking upon ourselves the right to try a case in the legislative branch instead of respecting the separation of powers by allowing cases to be tried in the judicial branch where they belong   instead of respecting separation of powers and honoring the rule,0
madam chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   madam chairman  i rise in support of hr 554  the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005   the food service industry employs some 12 million people  making it the nation s largest private sector employer   this vital sector of our economy has recently come under attack by lawsuits alleging it should pay monetary damages based upon legal theories holding it liable for the overconsumption of its products   hr ,1

mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,1
mr chairman  i appreciate this discussion today   the points i want to make are really more in the spirit of questions   i come out of a state legislative body where the proponents of a bill such as the gentleman from wisconsin would have to undergo a rigorous  almost crossexamination   we function here differently   but i do have some questions  and i think i will just present them in my comments and if somebody wants to comment on them they can   i heard one of the previous speakers ,0
mr chairman  i rise in opposition to the personal responsibility in food consumption act because i do nt think that any industry should have the right to conduct its business without the oversight of the judicial system   what the lawyerbashers do nt want you to know is that frivolous lawsuits  by definition  get thrown out of court   in other words  the muchfeared milliondollar settlement for someone who eats 12 big macs a day is not going to happen   that s why there are only a f,0
madam chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   madam chairman  i rise in opposition to this legislation   and as i said the last time we debated it  i do not rise because i am a supporter of frivolous lawsuits or lawsuits even that some of the people have used the legal system to pursue   i rise in opposition to the bill because i think it is an overreaction  and  indeed  i think it is perhaps an ultimate attestation to the fact that many of my colleagues have lost confiden,0

mr chairman  i rise today in strong support of hr 554  the personal responsibility in food consumption act   as a physician  and just as someone who can read the data  i can tell you that we have an epidemic of obesity in this country   obesity is a serious health problem  with very serious consequences   the most important step we can take to curb obesity is to impart to everyone in this country that obesity can be controlled when we take personal responsibility   a healthy and cons,1
mr speaker  this rule  house resolution 494  will allow the house to take up a bill limiting civil liability for the food and restaurant industry from obesity lawsuits   we have already debated this legislation once   we now have precious few legislative days left on the calendar and an everexpanding list of legislative priorities  yet the majority leadership has decided to take up a bill that preempts a handful of obesity lawsuits that are already being effectively handled in the courts,0
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  it is clear that today s legislation is not the answer   certainly it is not about addressing the larger issue  obesity  and its impact on the american health care system   this legislation demonstrates the blind eye the majority leadership is turning to the very real challenges americans are facing today   regardless of what happens with this legislation today  america s health care system will still be in dire need of,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   i rise in support of s 397  the protection of lawful commerce in firearms act   it will prohibit lawsuits against firearms manufacturers  legal distributors  dealers or importers for damages resulting from the misuse of a firearm by a third party   the bill is very similar to a house bill that i joined with the gentleman from florida  mr stearns   in sponsoring earlier this year   our house bill achieves the same objectives as,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to s 397  the gun manufacturers liability protection act   shielding gun manufacturers  dealers and distributors from liability is one of the most egregious forms of corporate welfare we ve considered in this house all year   this is george orwell legislation at its finest  all industries are equal  but some are more equal than others   if you sell beer to a 17yearold and he causes an accident  you can be held liable   but if you allow a 17,0
madam speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 493 and ask for its immediate consideration   ,1
mr speaker  in response to the gentleman from massachusetts  mr mcgovern   i want to point out that this bill prohibits lawsuits against a manufacturer or seller of a firearm or ammunition or notforprofit trade association for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm or ammunition   but it provides  as i said in my opening remarks  mr speaker  five exceptions to this liability protection  including  and i will just mention one in response to my good frien,1
reclaiming my time  i would again point out to the gentleman that it also would be an exception if a vendor knowingly did not keep an inventory so that they would have knowledge that dangerous weapons or firearms were actually stolen from their place of business   and that also is one of the exceptions   ,1
mr speaker  i want to point out that this bill on the house side  hr 800  which was passed  as i mentioned earlier by the house judiciary committee  this bill actually had 257 cosponsors  mr speaker   so this is certainly not a republican bill   you can do the math   my colleagues certainly can do the math on the other side of the aisle   but clearly  this bill had strong  strong bipartisan support   ,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act   i am an original cosponsor of the house version of this legislation  hr 800   a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer simply for being a gun manufacturer has no business in american courts   i am proud that every court in our judicial system has agreed with that and has thrown out these frivolous lawsuits   however  in us courts we have the american rule  where each side pays their own legal fees under nor,1

mr speaker  i rise in opposition to s 397  the protection of lawful commerce in arms act   my opposition to the measure is based on my belief that it is overly expansive and overarching   this bill prohibits civil liability lawsuits against gun manufacturers from being brought in federal or state court   my congressional district is beset by gun violence   i believe that gun owners  manufacturers and dealers must assume responsibility for the wanton gun violence that is being perpetrate,0
mr speaker  i thank my colleague from maryland for doing such a wonderful job on handling this issue   let me first say something   the legislation in front of us  as far as i am concerned  is frivolous   when we think about the millions and millions of lawsuits that have been filed over the last 10 years  only 57 have actually involved the gun industry  57  and for that we are taking time up here in congress   we hear constantly that this is a good bipartisan bill  that over 200 of ,0
madam speaker  i thank the gentleman from florida for yielding me this time   madam speaker  i oppose this closed rule and the underlying bill   this bill demonstrates how much of a stranglehold that the nra and gun industry lobbyists have over the majority party   this bill is not being considered today because it is good policy  it is being considered because the majority leadership is bowing down to special interests   while the proponents of this bill claim that the intent of this leg,0
mr speaker  the exception that he just cited would not cover the example that i just gave   the bottom line is that it was an employee who worked for kahr arms that stole these weapons and that sold them to criminals for drug money   as a result  a young man was killed   and it is our understanding  based on my conversations with members of the judiciary committee  that in fact this would not be covered   so having said that  i would urge my colleagues to vote `` no  on this bill   ,0
mr speaker  the gun industry would like to see this legislation passed today so that they can protect their profits   but i would like to talk about the real people who will be affected by this bill  people who have suffered enough   i would like to talk about a 26yearold father of two from my home state of massachusetts whose death was a direct result of negligence by a gun maker   five years ago  danny guzman was leaving a holiday party to go home to see his daughters  tammy and sele,0
mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to the `` protection of lawful commerce in arms act  this bill is an attempt to carve out an exclusive liability exemption  and its vote on the floor today is a giveback to the gun industry at a significant cost to the american people   under this bill  manufacturers and sellers of firearms or ammunition will not be held accountable for even the most irresponsible distribution of weapons that kill innocent people  including police officers ,0

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  i rise in support of s 397  the protection of lawful commerce in arms act   this legislation passed the senate by more than a twothirds vote this summer and contains the same legal reform provisions of hr 800 sponsored by the gentleman from florida  mr stearns     the committee on the judiciary considered and favorably reported hr 800 in may of this year   just like hr 800 and similar legislation that passed ,1

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this dangerous and misguided bill that would exempt gun dealers from liability even when they negligently sell weapons to criminals   it is particularly distressing that we are taking up this bill at this particular time   it was just 3 years ago this month  in october  when the community that i represent right outside here of washington  dc was terrorized by two snipers  who left 10 peo,0
mr speaker  i wish my colleague from virginia would come meet with 10 families from the washington area who had victims killed during the sniper attacks 3 years ago  as well as the police officers from new jersey  and tell them that those lawsuits were frivolous lawsuits   ,0
mr speaker  it seems that the charts that my colleague showed listing all the lawsuits actually make the case for how the system is working because  as he knows  many of those cases have been dismissed by the court   the court looked at them  and those cases that were frivolous  it decided to dismiss   so why are we trying to change the rules   it is because there are some cases that have merit  like the sniper cases and others  that would continue to go through  and under this legis,0

mr chairman  i rise in support of this legislation  which strengthens the language with regard to portfolios and gses   the gses claim that they are shock absorbers in the system   one of the main reasons that fannie and freddie claim they should not have their portfolios limited is that they provide a stable means of support for the residential finance markets at times of crisis   fannie s ceo  dan mudd  testified that `` our mortgage portfolio allows us to play a shockabsorbing funct,0
madam chairman  i yield myself 1 minute   we must remember what the original focus of the gses was when they were initially chartered by this congress  they were to do two things  and that is to provide liquidity to the marketplace and also to help provide for facilitating lowincome buyers coming into the marketplace   it is already set up in the law that the amount that gses can lend can go up every year   as it is right now  it stands at  359  000   it is set to go up to  400  000,0

mr chairman  it is with some reluctance i rise now in opposition to hr 1461  the federal housing finance reform act   in its amended form  the legislation no longer puts the best interest of our nation at heart  but instead holds a precious resource hostage for the sake of partisan politics   the provision restricting nonprofit organizations  and their affiliates  from using their own funds to engage in nonpartisan voter registration or getoutthevote activities if they want to ap,0
that is correct   but secondly  if you do not have concern for competitive equity  you put the taxpayer at greater risk because you will have weaker standards   you also drive a system that we will be putting all assets of a given kind of industry within a governmentally privileged institution   that is what the trends are   so this is both a taxpayer protection and free market protection   ,0

mr chairman  i am proud to follow my neighbor from texas  mr delay     ellington is in his district  but i am the next closest member   i rise to express my disapproval for the recommendations of the defense base realignment and closure and urge my colleagues to support the gentleman from illinois  resolution  of which i am a proud cosponsor   this is the most illadvised  illtimed round in base closure history   we currently have men and women fighting in two countries  and we pa,1

mr chairman  i yield myself the remaining time   several members have spoken eloquently about the fact that this is our job   mr taylor  did an excellent job of that   mr abercrombie  did an excellent job of that  that we ought to be making these decisions  that we should not turn it over to a commission   i would agree with that wholeheartedly  except this is a job that we simply can not seem to do   we did not close a major base in this country from the 1970s until the brac process,0
mr chairman  reclaiming my time  we did  following the introduction of the brac process  but we did close that   but we basically do not have the power to do that  because if i have the power to close mr skelton s base  he might vote to close my base  and we keep going around the room like that  and we are unable to do it   so the brac process has worked for better or for worse   i see both sides of it   i chaired a committee that oversees the brac process   i do not want any mor,0
mr chairman  i rise reluctantly in support of this motion   i have always supported the brac   i have been here through three of these  and i always thought they were well reasoned before  win  lose or draw  and by the standards of win  lose or draw  i probably came out okay in a lot of ways in this  because four out of five facilities in my area did well   the army did well in this brac   but i always thought the brac was based upon numbers and savings and mission  and suddenly i ,1
mr chairman  i thank the gentleman from illinois both for introducing this resolution and for yielding me some time to speak in support of the resolution   the stakes could not be higher   of course  we should take steps  even if politically difficult  to cut waste and improve efficiency in the military   let us look where we are   the pentagon has recommended closures through the brac commission   the brac commission has approved them   now the house is going to stamp them approved b,1

mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr chairman  tonight marks the end of a long and difficult process for selecting military installations for closure and realignment   under brac law  the realignment and closure recommendations by the brac 2005 commission will become binding  unless a joint resolution of disapproval  such as the one before us today  is enacted   for those of us with military installations in our districts  the brac process is a trying one   an,0
mr chairman  i thank the gentleman from missouri  mr skelton   for the opportunity to be heard   after a series of hearings and debates today  the house will vote on h j res 65  disapproving recommendation of the defense base closure and realignment commission   i stand here in opposition to that resolution and support the brac process   since the department of defense released those dreaded base closure recommendations on may 13  2005  elected officials  community leaders  and ,0
mr chairman  i rise in opposition to this resolution because i believe the brac commission has performed its job admirably   it wisely chose to remove from the closure list the defense finance and accounting services in cleveland which was scheduled to lose 1  028 jobs   this came after a very strong community effort in cleveland that was led by the greater cleveland partnership and attorney fred nance  whose brilliant presentation at the brac commission hearing was quite persuasive   it ,0
mr chairman  i would like to claim the 1 hour in support of the resolution   ,1
mr chairman  the reason that i introduced this resolution is because i feel very strongly that we are in a position in the house to send a very strong message of support to those who are doing the hard work in iraq  those who have done the hard work in afghanistan  and those men and women who we call our citizen soldiers  and a big debt of thanks for what they have been doing in the work that we have asked them to do   i have been a very strong supporter of the president s position when w,1
mr chairman  let me just speak for a minute or two   i thought there were going to be some other members that wanted to speak in favor of the resolution  but until they arrive  let me just talk for a minute or two about some of the costs   the brac commission estimated that  35 billion would be saved over a 20year period  but the  35 billion figure includes assumed cost savings due to military personnel actions   both the brac commission and the gao believe the military personnel savi,1

mr chairman  as a member of the house armed services committee  i reluctantly support the brac recommendations today  and oppose this motion of disapproval pending before the house   i support these recommendations because i believe that the goals of brac are worthy  to maximize warfighting capability and efficiency for both traditional warfighting and counterterrorist efforts   an integrated military force able to communicate and coordinate effectively in response to conflict remains cr,0
mr chairman  today  the house will likely vote not to reject the recommendations of the base realignment and closure commission  moving the brac process one step closer to an end   this has been a very difficult brac round for the state of maine   when the list came out 5 months ago  all of maine s three facilities were in great jeopardy  and few believed that we had a chance of saving any of them   but the entire delegation  the governor  and the communities came together and presen,0

mr chairman  i rise in support of the bill before us to reject the brac recommendations  and i thank the gentleman from illinois for his work on this bill   while this process has proceeded during a global war  many of us in congress  including me  have taken issue with the timing   doing this during a war and before we establish our global military footprint through the quadrennial defense review sends the wrong signal to our allies and to the soldiers and families who may depend on s,1
mr chairman  i stand in support of house joint resolution 65  disapproving the recommendations of the base realignment and closure commission   this will be my first vote against a brac list  and it is not a vote i take lightly   i support the brac process as a whole as a reasonable and apolitical method for evaluating our nation s defense infrastructure needs  and recognize the necessity of this first brac round in a decade   but while i salute the hard work of the brac commission memb,1
mr chairman  let me say initially i do not believe in the brac   i have opposed every brac initially from the very beginning  and i have been here in congress 18 years   the reason i do not believe in brac was somewhat articulated by the previous speaker   i think it is a abrogation of congress  responsibility   there is no reason why we can not make these decisions  and to give these decisions to an independent commission  i think  is just a copout on our part   so i want to start ,1
mr chairman  i appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important  legislation as i make a final push to keep forts gillem and mcpherson open by voting in support of a joint house resolution to reject the president s approval of the 2005 round of base realignments and closures   i cosponsored the measure  h j res 65  which disapproves the recommendations of the defense base realignment and closure commission  brac  as submitted by the president to congress on september 15  2005  ,1
mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i might consume   mr chairman  i have long supported the base closure process as a way to eliminate excess infrastructure in the department of defense   this is an important and very noble goal   we need all of our resources to be devoted towards supporting our fighting men and women   this includes having the best and most efficient facilities   for this reason  mr chairman  i will today vote to uphold the list recommended by the brac commiss,0

mr chairman  i thank the distinguished gentleman from colorado for the time   first  let me thank the brac commission head anthony principi and all of the panel members for their hard work for listening to all of us  both at the regional hearings and in person  and with the staff and the department of defense who worked with so many of us in these very difficult decisions   i rise in opposition to my colleague from illinois s resolution  but i share some of his concerns   i would like ,0
mr chairman  i have come to the same conclusion as the great gentleman from ohio  mr hobson     i have just probably been at it longer   article i  section 8 of the constitution gives congress the responsibility to provide for the national defense   it does not make us generals  it does not make us admirals   we do not tell admirals how to sink ships  we do not tell generals how to takes hills   we do  hopefully  provide sound business decisions for them   the whole concept of br,1

mr chairman  i would like to thank the gentleman from illinois for introducing this resolution   i will be voting today in favor of h j res 65 because i believe the brac commission s recommendations should be overturned   i commend the commission for their thorough and diligent work   they certainly had a very difficult job   however  i believe that now is not the time to implement a brac round  considering the number of operations our armed services are currently engaged in around t,1
mr chairman  i rise today in strong support of the resolution and join the growing chorus of the members of congress who are coming down to the floor today disappointed in the recommendations of the base realignment closure commission   i can not understand why  in a time that we are fighting a global war on terror  a war where we are actively engaged on two fronts and obligated to also increase domestic defense against terrorism here at home  the department of defense has suggested  in f,1
mr chairman  the base realignment process is designed to provide a more efficient and effective military structure   but  brac 2005 failed to meet these goals and that is why i will vote against implementing the recommendations of the department of defense and the base realignment commission   the base realignment recommendations fall short because they eliminate military resources and installations without producing meaningful costsavings   and  the base realignment recommendations fall,1
mr speaker  i am planning to speak in opposition to the bill  but i thought that i heard the gentleman say a minute ago that he planned to oppose it   is that correct   ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for yielding   i rise in opposition to the bill   we passed a bipartisan campaign finance reform act 3 or 4 years ago to close huge loopholes in campaign spending  including the soft money loophole   now the internet is becoming an increasingly important medium for campaign spending and advocacy   according to some surveys  37 percent of the adult population and 61 percent of americans use the internet to determine how they would vote ,0
mr speaker  today i rise in support of hr 1606  legislation that will exempt blogs  email and other online speech from campaign finance laws   when congress passed campaign finance reform in 2002  the legislation did not identify political speech over the internet as a target of the new regulations   the proponents of the law argued its intent was to restrict money not speech   but in april a federal judge sided with campaign finance reform zealots and ruled the fec can not completely,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to hr 1606  the online freedom of information act   this controversial bill purports to protect the freedom of speech of internet bloggers but instead creates a major internet loophole for soft money in our federal campaign finance laws   these are exactly the soft money expenditures the bipartisan campaign reform act of 1992  bcra  sought to prohibit   internet advertising should ,0
mr speaker  as i recall  it was the gentlewoman from california  ms zoe lofgren   who thought this would be an appropriate procedure to bring it to the floor on suspension   so there was no abuse of power   this is strongly supported by both parties   i anticipate it will pass today   otherwise  we will take a rule  and we will do it the regular way   ,1
mr speaker  i know the theme of the minority is the republicans abuse power and they are corrupt  but i think this example is absolutely ludicrous  given that it was recommended by a prominent democrat member of the house administration committee who happens to support the legislation   and she prudently recommended it because at the time it seemed like it was a relatively noncontroversial idea  supported by most of us   i would venture to guess that the outcome will be just as she assume,1
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  let us do that   let us defeat this now and send it to a rule   the gentleman from california s  mr doolittle   idea of a substantive defense is maybe a tribute to the gallantry that he continues to exemplify long after it may have gone out of fashion   he says the reason this is a good idea is that the gentlewoman from california  ms zoe lofgren   said so   i highly esteem my colleague from california with whom i disagree in this case   but the not,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  you said all of the members there present   how many were there   ,0
mr speaker  how many republicans   ,0
mr speaker  so apparently four or five members have been able to do this   i will repeat that we have heard no substantive defense of why this came   i would agree with what the gentlewoman from california  ms zoe lofgren   said  sometimes you do not know something is controversial  but once you learn that it is  then you have the regular procedure   ,0
mr speaker  again  invoking one other individual does not pass for substantive debate   i am surprised   do you not understand what real argument is   ,0
mr speaker  i rise today to oppose hr 1606 and ask us to come back with a procedure that will permit the shaysmeehan alternative   this bill opens a huge loophole in the campaign finance laws   the gentleman from massachusetts  mr meehan   and others have been bulldogs in moving us toward a more perfect democratic union by keeping government of and by the people  not of and by some of the people and by special interests  and this act would not add protections of freedom of speech on ,0
i do   ,1
mr speaker  i did opine at the hearings  since there was complete agreement among all of the members present  that we did not want to regulate the internet  that we might be able to take care of this on the suspension calendar   and i never have felt so powerful in the minority as i do today   ,1
mr speaker  i was the only democrat present   ,1
mr speaker  i do not remember   ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time   mr speaker  i understand the procedural objections to this  and certainly when i made the suggestion during our hearing that we could probably handle this on the suspension  i believed that was the case   obviously  there is more controversy than i had believed at the time   but i still believe that this bill is very much worth supporting  and i do support this bill   if i believed what the new york times and the washingt,1

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  let me thank all of my colleagues who participated in this debate   let me  once again  remind those who are following this debate that we are talking about a free trade agreement with bahrain  a country which is about the same size as the city of austin  whose total trade with the united states is measured in terms of a couple hundred million dollars   it is a country with a high standard of living for that region whose ,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong support of this agreement  and i want to begin by extending my congratulations to the distinguished chairman of the trade subcommittee for his fine work on this effort and to thank him along with my friend from wisconsin and my friend from texas  both of whom are here on the floor and who worked closely with us  with our working group  to promote the issue of trade   my friend from florida is absolutely right  if we do not shape the global economy  we will b,1
reclaiming my time  i will respond to that question   ,1
the gentleman posed the question  and i am happy to respond to that question  and then i will continue with my statement   on average  jobs that are focused on exports into new markets  which is exactly what these agreements are all about  exactly what these agreements are all about  on average  these jobs focused on exports pay about 17 percent higher wage rates than those that are focused on jobs that are merely designed for domestic consumption here   ,1
if i could reclaim my time  let me just say that it is fascinating to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle who  when we were in the midst of our debate just a few minutes ago on the alternative minimum tax  they were very strong proponents of making sure we bring about reform so that people who are in that wage rate that goes all the way up to  342  000 a year get relief under the amt   so i believe that if you look at the jobs that have been created  if you look at the wag,1
mr speaker  i thank my friend for that contribution  showing  as i said  that the standard of living in the united states of america is strong   and the president has put it very well  we are never going to be satisfied until every american who wants a job has a job   we must continue to do everything possible to ensure that that happens  and that again is what this agreement is about   ninetyfour percent of the world s consumers are outside of our borders  mr speaker   so i belie,1
mr speaker  i thank my friend from washington state  mr hastings   for the time  and i yield myself such time as i may consume   sometimes these rules cause confusion when there are two mr hastings  managing the rule   so in advance  mr speaker  i am sure that my good friend and i want to make sure that there is no confusion   mr speaker  my good friend and colleague has already pointed out the closed rule we are working on today is mandated by the fact that we are dealing with a ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  again we have an opportunity to stand up for american families   again  we have an opportunity to stand up for free trade and pass the usbahrain free trade agreement   this is a simple matter   free trade delivers a greater choice of goods and services to american consumers at lower prices   that means families can buy more using less of their paychecks   more trade means more competition  and competition ha,1
mr speaker  the house of representatives is today considering a proposed free trade agreement between the united states and bahrain   i support this agreement  and will vote in favor of the required implementing legislation   i also anticipate this agreement will enjoy strong bipartisan support in congress   in general  i have advocated free trade and open markets because i believe that american businesses and workers can compete and win in the global economy   furthermore  i believe th,1
mr speaker  let me share with you the real facts of this trade bill  and let me thank mr cardin  mr levin  and mr rangel  for really doing the heavy lifting which has created an opportunity for real debate on a good trade bill   there are concerns that my colleagues have raised about this trade bill  but i think there are provisions and there are reasons for us to give an open and free flowing discussion to a vital partner that we have had for many  many years   it is important to no,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of hr 4340  the `` united statesbahrain free trade agreement implementation act  in spite of my support  i do have some concerns   for example  as in all other us free trade agreements  fta s  the text of the usbahrain free trade agreement requires only that the two countries enforce their own labor laws   it is my understanding that in 2002  bahrain completed a major revision to its own labor laws to comply with internationallyrecognized stan,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to hr 4340  the bahrain trade agreement   although our trade with bahrain is limited  this agreement is a symptom of what is wrong with our nation s trade policies   i firmly believe that we should have a thorough review of the impact of these free trade agreements so that we can create a national trade policy that protects the american manufacturing industries   we need an american trade policy that encourages the export of american manufactured goods ,0
mr speaker  i rise today in support of the united statesbahrain free trade agreement implementation act   passage of this fta will help strengthen our relationship with bahrain  building a more secure and productive future for our countries and citizens   as a cochair of the new democrat coalition  i have long believed that when instituted correctly and fairly  trade agreements open up foreign markets to us goods  create new opportunities for companies and their employees  and lift t,1
mr speaker  today i support hr 4340  the usbahrain free trade agreement   bahrain is an important political  economic and military ally  and in the years since 911  has been a valued partner in the war on terror   the usbahrain free trade agreement will strengthen this key relationship and bolster the important reforms currently taking place in bahrain   bahrain deserves special recognition for its military cooperation with the united states military   since 1995  bahrain has,1
mr speaker  i rise today in support of hr 4340  the united statesbahrain free trade agreement implementation act   this agreement is an example of the success that bipartisan engagement on trade issues can generate  and this agreement should be a model  a starting point  for how we can achieve success in the future   during consideration of this agreement in the ways and means committee  democrats expressed their concern about the treatment and application of international labor sta,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from maryland  mr cardin   for the time   workers rights matter to the rules of competition negotiated in trade agreements   in order to make globalization work  and i emphasize this  its benefits must flow broadly among the majority of the population  not flow to the top and merely trickle down to the rest   to spread the benefits of globalization  workers must have internationally recognized core labor rights  prohibitions on child labor  forced ,1
mr speaker  continuing my support for an overwhelming majority of free trade agreements  i cast my vote in favor the usbahrain free trade agreement  fta    in the past i have expressed serious concerns over copyright provisions contained in some free trade agreements negotiated by the bush administration that arguably constrain the ability of the united states to modernize our laws to reflect the realities of technology   i have been repeatedly reassured that notwithstanding these copy,1
mr speaker  i rise today in strong support of the bahrain free trade agreement   this agreement is good for the united states  and it is good for bahrain   it has real trade benefits   but beyond that  it will strengthen relations with one of our most steadfast friends in the middle east   progress made on labor and economic reforms can stand as a model for future trade agreements with the middle east   the ways and means committee s bipartisan approval of the usbahrain free trade a,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  i think working out the details in this bill is a classic example as to how we can be bipartisan when we really try   there is no question that foreign policy and trade should not be a republican or democratic issue   and the gentleman from maryland  mr cardin   made up his mind that we were going to stick to it to make certain that some of our concerns about the basic protection of workers was going to be included in ,1
mr speaker  in closing  though  i would also like to point out that the gentleman from wisconsin  mr ryan    a junior member of the committee  spent considerable time working with us and working with us through the united states trade representative in order to make certain that we reached this conclusion  and i will be supporting this piece of legislation   ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for his leadership on all the free trade agreements and his leadership on so many difficult issues   i rise in strong support of the usbahrain free trade agreement   this fta represents an important step toward a more prosperous and economically vibrant middle east   the broad scope of this agreement and its consideration for environment and labor standards  as well as provisions that address other foreign policy concerns  makes the usbahrain agreem,1

mr speaker  we have heard throughout this debate a lot of reference to the trade deficit   i think it is important to look at that   when you look at our nation s trade deficit  we enjoy a very large surplus in services  and our trade deficit comes from a trade deficit in manufactured goods   mr speaker  according to the latest statistics  94 percent of our trade deficit comes from countries we do not have a free trade agreement with   a free trade agreement like this agreement helps,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding  and along with millions of american workers in the aflcio  i rise in very strong opposition to this flawed agreement   mr speaker  here we go again   once more  the proponents of unfettered free trade are telling us about all of the good jobs that will be created if we pass this agreement and how great this agreement will be for the economy  and once again  they will be wrong   let me be as clear as i can be   our unfettered free trad,0

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  the gentleman from california  mr stark   mentioned that we were trying to reward our friends in some way   and we hear from the gentleman who just left the well about cafta and going back and rehashing cafta  talking about votes in the middle of the night   i would like to pose this question  what is wrong with trying to reward our friends   that is who we want to promote business with is our friends   there is no,1

mr speaker  i want to add another provision there  that over the last 3 years  hourly wages have increased in the united states by 8 percent   so a lot of this stuff we have heard is absolutely false   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  i would also like to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from maryland   i think he spoke quite eloquently about the importance of this agreement to the region   when the history of the middle east is written  i think the historians will view this trade bill as an important stepping stone towards the development and imposition of democracies and stability in that part of the world  which is very much in our b,1

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  i would like to associate myself with some of the remarks of my distinguished friend from maryland   he is right  bahrain is a flea on the elephant when it comes to the difference that it will make in economic impact to the united states   but if we really wanted to help in the middle east  maybe we would have sold parts for c130s to iran and saved 100 people from dying because of our embargo on selling aircraft parts to a,0
mr speaker  it is with some hesitation that i rise in support of the usbahrain free trade agreement or fta   as the home to the 5th fleet of the us navy  bahrain is a key gulf ally   i believe this agreement will reinforce that bond with stronger economic ties   the bahrain fta also presents an opportunity to build upon trade agreements with morocco  jordan  israel and the palestinian authority and provides an incentive for economic integration throughout the region   another reaso,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill  the usbahrain free trade agreement implementation act   through cooperation  democrats working alongside republicans on the ways and means committee  who then coordinated with the administration  we have before us a strong trade package that will open markets  advance free trade and cement america s ties to a strategically important ally in the middle east   and with the changes that are coming to bahrain s labor ,1
mr speaker  i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks   mr speaker  this bill is easy to describe  tax cuts for millionaires and tax increases for the middle class   this bill misses the biggest tax cut priority of this congress  the alternative minimum tax  or amt   the amt was designed to prevent the wealthy from avoiding federal taxes by taking too many exemptions  but it was never adjusted for inflation   therefore  many middleclass american families are being a,0
mr speaker  since i first came to congress  i made it a priority to restore sales tax deductibility for my constituents in washington state   last year  working with a bipartisan coalition lead by mr kevin brady  and myself  we did successfully do that   this deduction saved washington state taxpayers over  500 million last year alone   unfortunately  the sales tax deduction will expire at the end of this year  and we must extend that deduction   accordingly  i applaud both the dem,0
mr speaker  i am well aware of the issues with amt   the issue with me is this  you have not paid for it  the democrats have   what you are not talking about is you are passing deficit on to our kids   you are passing debt on to our kids   i visited with high schools and had town halls last weekend  and people said they are desperately concerned about the size of the nation s deficit and the size of the nation s debt   the democratic package is paid for  the republican package is no,0
mr speaker  like many of my colleagues  i spent much of the thanksgiving recess holding office hours throughout my congressional district to listen to the concerns of my constituents   understandably  i heard how worried they are about skyrocketing energy prices  our lack of progress in iraq  rising health care costs  and the recently passed budget cuts that predominately hurt the poor   one need look no further than the tax bill on the floor today to see why many americans are frustrat,0
mr speaker  this has been an interesting debate  as it always seems like it is these days in this house   in 2003  i actually thought we did some very good things with the tax cuts we implemented  and i thought we did them for families back home in all of our districts   so on august 2  2005  i joined with a colleague of mine from colorado  congresswoman musgrave  a member of the small business committee  and we explored the effect of at least one of those tax cuts that we are talkin,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i urge the members of this body to support the rangel substitute   if we recall the words of a famous president this country had  a man of heroic proportions  harry truman  he said  `` the buck stops here  and  unfortunately  we are forgetting the words of harry truman because today it seems like the mantra of the leadership in this house of representatives is the buck stops with your children or perhaps you,0
mr speaker  at this time  i would like to yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina for a couple of minutes   she is going to talk with us about her time on the road this week with the president as the president visited in her area in north carolina  and she had the opportunity to not only talk tax reforms with the president  but to listen to her constituents in north carolina and to hear what was on their mind as they enjoyed that visit and as they had prepared for that visit   ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman from north carolina and i thank her for taking the time this week to look at how workers continue educating themselves and preparing and participating in a changing economy  a changing job market   i mentioned the diversity of experience that comes to this body and what goes into looking at these policies and how we remain competitive  what we need to do to be competitive and the decisions we make  how tax and government budgeting and spending affects th,1
if the gentleman will yield  i want us to talk a little more about the deficit dropping  because that is one of the true benefits that we do see from this   and individuals who are at home and watching and listening to this conversation that we are having tonight  they can go to the treasury department web site  they can go to the congressional budget office and they can pull up these figures so that they can see these are solid figures   these are not our numbers   this is not political ,1
if the gentleman will yield  let us talk about some of these provisions that are in the bill that is going to be before us   because we do not want the democrat tax increase to take place  and that is why the leadership in this house is working to be certain that we pass our tax relief extension reconciliation act   and if individuals are going to go on and look at this  it is house resolution 4297   i think they would like to see some of the provisions that are in here   the gentleman fr,1
if the gentleman will yield  yes  for those of us in nonincome tax states that means that you are voting to take that deduction away from them   another one that you would be voting to take away is the abovetheline deduction for outofpocket teacherclassroom expenses   extending that deduction for our nation s teachers is included in this bill   i have so many of my friends that i went through college with who are teachers  and many of them have been teaching for about 30 years now  ,1
mr speaker  the gentleman is exactly right because that is what it would be   at this time of year  coming in and voting a tax increase  voting a tax increase on our nation s small businesses  voting a tax increase on our nation s families   to us  that is unacceptable   we know that the rate of economic growth in this nation  the jobs growth  has shown that the tax reforms that have been passed work and they yield results   another provision that is included in this bill is the we,1
the gentleman is accurate on that   individuals that vote no on this tomorrow would be voting to increase that on our nation s teachers   they would be voting no on state sales tax deductibility   they would be voting against that  for all of our constituents in tennessee and texas and washington state and wyoming and other states across the nation that enjoy that sales tax deductibility   another one they would be voting no on is the savers  tax credit for lowincome workers who contribu,1
mr speaker  there are over 91 million americans who own shares of stock in companies in this country  91 million americans who have invested in that capital creation process  invested in these companies   when we talk about capital gains and dividends  sometimes we think as you are saying  well  that is just somebody else   that does not apply to me   but for individuals that have 401  k  s and retirement plans  yes it does   what we are seeing is that 51 percent of our taxpaying ,1
mr speaker  the gentleman is precisely right on that   again  the bill tomorrow is hr 4297   it is the tax relief extension reconciliation act  and it is called the tax relief extension because these are reliefs that were passed in 2003   as we have continued to talk through the evening  these are the provisions that have really created this robust economy that we are seeing  41 percent gdp growth just this last quarter   i think it is so important that we keep our focus there   th,1

i thank the gentleman from texas  and i thank him so much for being here to talk with us tonight about why this is important legislation and why it is important that we stop a tax increase on the american people   and we have talked about so many of these issues tonight   mr speaker  this economy is booming   inflation is low   unemployment is near historic lows   we saw that 41 percent growth with the quarter that ended in september of 2005   and i think it is important to realize tha,1
mr speaker  i rise to support the underlying bill and to oppose the substitute   and this is the reason why  my state  tennessee  has seen more than  250 million in taxpayer savings a year from the sales tax deduction we passed in 2004   the tax relief extension act that we are passing today will extend that   there is no excuse not to support this matter of tax fairness for states like mine   it is great for our economy  it is great for tennessee s main streets   and those hundreds,1
mr speaker  i am in opposition to the substitute because i am for the underlying bill and i am for the things it has done for our economy   one of the great changes that this bill showed in what happens in the federal government is a belief that people are better at solving economic problems than government is   when the tax structure that we are voting today to extend was put in place  the determination was made that we were in a difficult economic time  and the way to get out of that dif,1
i appreciate my colleague from michigan  his leadership in helping boost our economy  extend this tax relief   i strongly support the original bill over the substitute   the substitute takes a step backward in how we treat our soldiers and how we treat our families  small businesses that are affected by the alternative minimum tax  compared to legislation that this house passed just yesterday  we treated soldiers better  by providing them immediate cash refunds on their tax treatment   ,1
mr speaker  it is  i think  a terrible mistake to leave out tax relief for dividends   these are the usually small amounts of money that go to people  many seniors  who have invested in a company  and these are the dividends that help ease their retirement   back a few years ago  we saw a number of wall street companies go under  the enrons  the worldcoms  all those dotcom technology companies   they had big stock prices   they had great pieces of paper saying they were wonderful,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i just want to point out to the members that yesterday the house passed the gulf opportunities zone act 4154 which dealt with many items to help gulf coast area residents who had been hurt by the hurricane  incentives to help rebuild housing  investment to provide depreciation and expensing for small businesses  bonding authority so that taxexempt bond authority could help rebuild devastated infrastructure in the hurricane zone   s,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  i would say to my friend from new york that we have dealt with the amt issue   in our legislation  we did not choose to raise taxes  as the gentleman s substitute does  to the tune of  40 billion   so because of that  the amt is done outside of the reconciliation process   when i hear so many on the other side of the aisle talk about highincome earners  i remind members that many small businesses in the united st,1
mr speaker  and the  40 billion in taxes in the democrat substitute certainly will not give many americans a break   ,1

mr speaker  i yield myself 2 minutes   actually  in a few minutes we will have a vote on two tax bills  and we have heard a lot of debate this afternoon about the two approaches the bill takes  and i certainly appreciate my friends on the other side for recognizing the need for tax relief   in fact  in many important ways these bills are very similar   twentytwo provisions in our underlying bill were taken by my friends on the other side and put into their bill   i guess imitation is ,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the substitute and in favor of the underlying bill   i want to talk about some of the allegations that have been brought up in this debate   one is the fact that perhaps by continuing the tax policies or extending the reduction in tax rate  especially in the area of tax dividends and capital gains tax  that somehow we are aggravating the deficit   i think that the evidence is pretty conclusive that we have seen a tremendous stimulus and tremendous growt,1
mr speaker  let me thank the gentleman from new york for yielding me this time  and thank him for putting together a substitute that makes sense  that is an important bill   yes  it is important to extend the expiring tax provisions  and the rangel substitute does that   research and development  the work opportunity tax credit  all the important tax provisions that will expire  the substitute extends those provisions   that is important   the rangel substitute does another thing th,0
mr speaker  imagine if we could bring a piece of legislation to the floor of this house that would  over the next 30month period of time  result in benefits that every american could share in   things like increasing business investments by 25 percent  growing the value of the stock market by over  4 trillion   creating 44 million new jobs   reducing the unemployment from 63 to 5 percent   having quarterly gdp grow at an average of 41 percent   increase tax receipts by  274 billi,1
mr speaker  i rise day in opposition to hr 4297  the tax relief extension reconciliation act   i do so because i do not believe we should be cutting taxes for the wealthiest americans while we are at war and at the same time cutting programs for our most vulnerable populations and adding to the staggering debt load of our children and grandchildren   this bill is not fiscally responsible  and we neglect the ramifications of the budget priorities of the majority party to the detriment of ,0
it is extraordinary   if you assert something that is not true  it is true on the floor of the house   there is no truth test here   cut taxes for the rich  it will stimulate the economy   put the little people to work who will pay taxes for their job cutting the lawns or washing their yachts   that is the argument we are hearing from that side of the aisle   trickle down economics works  they tell us   unfortunately  that is not what most americans find with their real incomes stalle,0

mr speaker  i rise in strong support of this very modest tax relief proposal and the rule that brings it to the floor  and especially in support of the deduction for state and local sales taxes which is so very important to my home state of tennessee and many millions of people throughout this nation   every day we read stories about how wasteful the federal government is  and certainly it has been proven over and over again how the least efficient  most wasteful way to spend money is to t,1
mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to this republican plan for the wealthiest americans   president kennedy once said  `` to govern is to choose  so let us look at the choices   this tax cut falls on the heels of a deficit reduction plan passed before thanksgiving that cut children s health care  child care assistance  college aid  child support  and will actually increase the deficit by  20 billion   that is what they refer to as new math in america   what kind of con,0
mr speaker  today we have the opportunity to pass a bill that i believe will provide a powerful tonic for continued economic growth as a precedent for social justice   since 2003  when much of the current tax policies were enacted  our gdp has seen its fastest growth in 20 years  averaging a robust 44 percent growth per quarter   this growth  mr speaker  is attributable in part to reduced rates on capital gains and dividends   i would like to highlight who in the real world is receiv,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this latest wasteful republican tax bill and in strong support of the rangel substitute   the rangel bill is a responsible effort to extend needed tax relief and protect middle class americans from the alternative minimum tax  amt   but the underlying legislation is the latest installment of the failed republican budget policies that have devastated this country s finances and much of our economy   i strongly believe that congress must return to,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   i rise to support the underlying bill and to oppose the democratic substitute   the numbers three  four  and five come to mind   three is basically a reflection of what our inflation rate is at  four for the percentage of which our economy is growing on an annual basis  and five for unemployment rate that exists in this country with historic lows   one way we can ensure that that number five comes even lower and that number four ,1
mr speaker  i would like to thank my friend and colleague on the rules committee for allowing me this opportunity to speak on behalf of this rule and the underlying bill  hr 4297  the tax relief extension reconciliation act   today  each and every member of this house is taking a test before the american people   this test has one question  and simply enough  it is even multiple choice   the question is  who do you trust more to spend your hardearned money   is it  a  the federa,1
mr speaker  i thank the chairman for yielding me time   mr speaker  i rise in support of hr 4297 because this legislation will ensure that our economy will continue to expand   that is right  expand   if you would listen to those on the other side of the aisle  you would think that we are in a shrinking economy   however  since the capital gains and dividend taxes were reduced in 2003  we have seen ten straight quarters of what is it   growth   now  what does growth mean   it m,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the democrat substitute   this proposal actually does not continue some very important provisions for low income americans   it does not extend a savers credit which actually allows a match for savings for poorer people by the government   their substitute does not include an expensing provision for small businesses that allows them to use more of their money instead of sending it to the government so that they can grow their business and create jobs   i,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong support of the legislation precisely because of the challenges outlined by my friend from mississippi   as my friend from michigan just pointed out  yesterday this house took steps to reignite the engines of economic opportunity  to deal with job creation and getting help to the people of the gulf coast   i would assure this house  mr speaker  this is not some sort of abstraction   as my friend from mississippi knows  brother rex yancey  the pastor of fir,1
mr speaker  i certainly thank the gentlewoman for yielding and certainly appreciate her leadership in this body on helping promote policies that promote economic growth in jobs and being a true leader in trying to help reform government programs that too often take away from family programs because they are wasteful  they are duplicative  they are inefficient  there is no accountability   she is one of the true leaders in congress on these issues   mr speaker  there is a lot of good new,1
well  i thank the gentleman from georgia for his insight  and i certainly appreciate his bringing the chart because it dramatically illustrates this phenomena  that if you will simply allow the american people to keep more of what they earn  allow small businesses to keep more of what they earn  they will roll up their sleeves and expand   they are going to go out and create a new transmission repair shop on one street corner or a new barbecue stand on another corner   somebody will have ,1
well  this is an excellent line of debate that the gentlewoman is developing here   and again it is very important that the american people know this week we do not have a bill on the floor to provide tax relief for the american people   we have a bill on the floor to prevent a democrat tax increase   there will be an automatic tax increase on the american people if we do not pass this legislation  and one of the things that we will lose is the ability of small businesses to expense what we,1
mr speaker  that is a very important point   i know when this debate takes place tomorrow  and we have heard about so many of the great tax relief provisions which have been passed for american families and small business  and how they are going to be taken away tomorrow if we do not defeat this democrat tax increase  but the capital gains and dividends  we know the rhetoric   the class warfare rhetoric of our friends on the other side of the aisle  we know it is coming   yet i sit her,1
mr speaker  over half of americans are invested in the stock market   they do have some form of dividend or capital gains and it is really their nest egg   those are the 401  k  plans to help them in their retirement years   that is money that is put away for education for their children  and yet our democrat colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to tax away that dream   they want to tax away that nest egg by passing a huge tax increase tomorrow   that is over half of american,1
mr speaker  i appreciate again the gentlewoman yielding  and i appreciate her point that is so important that tax relief has driven job creation   you take away the tax relief  as our democrat colleagues are trying to do  and you end up taking away the jobs   let me again return to my congressional district   as i said earlier this evening  how proud i am that i have the honor of representing the fifth congressional district in texas   there is a small business there named hugh dublin ,1
and it is just so important that everybody realize this connection between preserving tax relief  preventing a tax increase and preserving our jobs   again  over 4 million new jobs created in this economy since we passed tax relief   why would we want to go back   why would we want to take that tax relief away and pass a huge tax increase  because that affects real people all across america   let me give you another example   i talked earlier about the fact that we are enjoying the highe,1
well  again  it illustrates just how valuable the tax relief has been to our economy   we have spoken this evening at length about over 4 million new jobs   four million new jobs in the future that have been created   four million new paychecks   that is what compassion is all about   compassion is not measured by the number of welfare checks that are printed in washington   it is measured by the number of paychecks that are printed all over the united states of america   our gdp growth,1
mr speaker  unless we enact hr 4297  americans will receive a most unwelcomed christmas gift from the democrats  a huge automatic tax increase   this will cost families billions of their dollars and jeopardize millions of their jobs   we can not sit idly by and let the democrats do this   tax relief has already created more than 44 million new jobs  but if you raise taxes  you start taking these jobs away   mr speaker  let me tell you about a few of the jobs from my east texas dis,1
mr speaker  unless we enact hr 4297 and defeat the democratic substitute  americans will receive a most unwelcome christmas gift from the democrats  a huge automatic tax increase   this will cost families billions of dollars and jeopardize millions of their jobs   mr speaker  let me tell you just about a few of those jobs that could be lost in my east texas district if the democrats have their way in raising taxes   hugh dublin owns a small business called east texas right of way in m,1
mr speaker  today s legislation contains a number of important tax relief provisions  including an expanded research and development credit to keep american innovation competitive  and one supported by my friend from wisconsin  paul ryan  which would adjust the qualified veterans mortgage bond program and expand access to affordable home loans for california veterans who served after 1977   in addition  the bill before us includes a measure that i have long supported to facilitate great,1
mr speaker  today we return for part two of the budget reconciliation bill   just before thanksgiving  the republican majority cut investments in education  american competitiveness  and programs for the needy   today  they will give a tax cut to the top 1    it is a reverserobin hood value system   apparently  the republican leadership thinks that the middle class is not working hard enough   they believe that the middle class needs to work harder so that the top 1  can take home,0
mr speaker  here we are just 2 weeks after house republicans claimed that they were restoring fiscal discipline to the federal budget considering a tax bill that will make our deficits worse and drive our nation even further into debt   in 5 short years  the republican party s failed economic policies have instigated  157 trillion in budget deficits and added  3 trillion to the national debt   by the way  during the last 4 years of the clinton administration  we added not a nickel to ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   mark twain is probably the most famous constituent from my district and i think it was his quote that said  `` there are lies  there are damn lies  and there are statistics  i would say probably folks that are back in my district are home from school today because we had snow   maybe people are taking a break from christmas shopping and tuning into the debate  and i suspect folks are a little perplexed and a little confused   i,1
mr speaker  we have before us a very important piece of legislation  hr 4297  the tax reconciliation act   it is very important to understand this piece of legislation within the big picture the republicans are painting here   just last month  the republicans passed a bill called `` the deficit reduction act  this was a spending cut bill that slashed funding to many vital programs my constituents depend on  including to medicaid  student loans  food stamps  and child support prog,0
mr speaker  i rise today in support of the tax relief extension act   let me make absolutely clear what this bill does   the bill will prevent automatic tax increases on millions of americans and their families   unless congress acts  individuals will pay higher taxes on their savings  businesses will lose valuable incentives to provide research in the united states  small businesses will lose the ability to expense new equipment  essential to the support of new employees   these are a,1
mr speaker  i am pleased to rise today in support of this bill and the resilient american economy   this act will build on our legacy of tax relief that is fueling our economy  and will extend some very important tax provisions that will keep america s economy moving forward   freedom and free enterprise go handinhand   and keeping tax rates low so people have more of their hardearned money in their pockets is the right way to go   texans want  need  and deserve to have their sales ,1
mr speaker  i would like to compliment my chairman  mr charles rangel  for his leadership on this issue   i am glad to be on the ways and means committee and glad to have the opportunity to talk about some of these taxing issues   it just amazes me that the majority can stand here and have the gall to tell veterans that they are going to treat them better  to tell the people of america that they are better at solving problems than the government and so we are going to give them two cents,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time   what the majority is seeking to accomplish here is another transfer of wealth from the great mass of americans to a privileged few   this bill would raise taxes on 17 million american middleclass families by as much as  640   millionaires get tax cuts as much as  32  000   people who bet on the market are going to see their taxes cut or reduced  while workers are not going to see that kind of relief because this bill is a,0
mr speaker  today i rise in strong support of the rangel substitute to hr 4297  the tax reconciliation act and in opposition to the underlying bill   instead of stopping a tax increase for the middle class in 2006  republicans have chosen to keep taxes low for the wealthiest americans in 2009   what kind of priorities favor the wealthy in the future over working families today   we can ill afford the continued `` tax cut and spend  mentality that has marked the house during the last f,0
mr speaker  i rise in support of the democratic alternative to hr 4297  tax relief extension reconciliation act that would provide real tax relief to working families and help the economy grow   the underlying bill is more of the same  more fiscally irresponsible policy   the president s policy of `` stay the course  is not working  it s not working in our foreign policy  domestic policy  budget policy or tax policy   more of the same is just not working and now is the time for ,0
mr speaker  the issue here is priorities and choices   there are some similarities  but the differences are vast   let us look at the whole picture here  the whole picture   you have an alternative minimum tax that is going to hit millions of people if we do not act   we have  45 billion in extenders on which there is basic agreement   we have a reduction in the capital gains and dividends tax which continues for the next few years   we have proposed budget cuts   we also have the al,0
mr speaker  i want to thank the gentlewoman from new york for yielding me this time   mr speaker  once again  i rise in disbelief about what the house is about to do today   it is my belief that we are moving down the wrong road   before we left for thanksgiving  the republican leadership twisted arms to pass a bill slashing funding for vital programs that benefit the neediest americans   some might say that the bill was callous   i say that the bill was immoral   today  it is still,0
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this  56 billion tax break  mostly for millionaires in our country   fortyfive percent of this tax break goes to the ultra rich in our country  the top 1 percent average getting  32  000 apiece in tax breaks out of this bill   so how do they get the money   well  last month  the republicans lectured us on the need to have fiscal discipline   they had to cut medicaid for the poorest seniors and kids   they had to cut student loans for chil,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   mr speaker  it is a curious application of tax benefits that have been left out of the minority substitute   let me just go over a few of those because i think you will agree with me that it is curious which ones are left out   the savers credit for low income families   my friends on the other side of the aisle continually stand up for low income families and to their credit  why on earth would they leave out a strong incentive f,1
mr speaker  i got up this morning and here is the washington post s eminent columnist  david broder   he begins his story  `` if the house of representatives were a person  it would be blushing these days   unfortunately  the house is beyond embarrassment  now  i used this before  but i wanted to bring it out here again because i think we need to demonstrate to people what is going on   we have christmastime  and we have socks   we have poor people s socks and rich people s so,0
mr speaker  you say one thing for political cover  and then you do another thing for your friends   that is what we are doing here today   just last month the speaker said  `` i will tell you that the most meanspirited thing we can do is leave our children with a debt they can not pay  that came from the speaker   that did not come from our side   that is the authority of the majority in this house   well  the words were right   but  you know  the speaker knows  and i know him ,0
mr speaker  i just heard the gentleman from wisconsin talk about job creation   he singled out one month   22 million jobs created during the clinton years   22 million   economic growth has been paltry and everybody knows it   in addition to which he talked about the deficit  with a straight face   they have rolled up the national deficit   22 trillion we are in the hole   on their time this has happened   let me say this and i think it is very important to point out  mr speake,0
i am happy to participate   ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from new york  mr rangel   for yielding me time   the chairman did raise a rhetorical question   let me give a rhetorical answer   we are all so desperate here after these 10 years of republican rule to do something about amt we are prepared to vote for any procedure that comes before this institution just to hopefully move it along   remember  when the republicans took control  200  000 people were paying amt   next year 193 million people will be,0
mr speaker  i want to thank the gentleman from new york  mr rangel   for offering this motion to recommit today   the rangel motion to recommit is about two things  truth in budgeting and truth in borrowing   in almost 14 years now on the ways and means committee  we have spoken of addressing the alternative minimum tax issue   there has been a lot of talk and not a lot of action   and you are going to hear in a couple of seconds  well  yesterday  we took up the alternative minimum,0
mr speaker  i thank the distinguished gentleman from new york  our ranking member on the ways and means committee  for yielding me the time   i thank you and our colleagues on the committee on the democratic side for the excellent work you did in putting forth the democratic alternative today   you have made an excellent case for your substitute and indictment against what the republicans are doing   let us talk about what is happening here today   a few weeks ago  right before thanksgi,0
mr speaker  much of the rhetoric coming from the majority in defense of this sinful package is pure fiction   so let us discuss it in those terms   you know  charles dickens has written perhaps one of the most famous pieces of fiction discussed at this time of year  the holiday season  a christmas carol   the lesson of christmas carol  scrooge  this miserly man  very  very well fixed financially that chose not to give to others   and we know that in the course of this beautiful stor,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding   the preceding speaker on the republican side said we have got to pass this  we have got to continue the progrowth policies   she was talking specifically as she referenced capital gains and dividends   well  the fact is the very tax cuts that she is talking about remain in place   they are in existing law for 2006  for 2007  for 2008   doing nothing keeps the very provisions she was hyperventilating about just a moment ago   but what ,0
mr speaker  by direction of the committee on rules  i call up house resolution 588 and ask for its immediate consideration   ,1
mr speaker  for the purpose of debate only  i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from rochester  new york  ms slaughter    pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume   ,1
mr speaker  in april congress passed a responsible budget that called for spending restraint  reduction of the deficit  and by slowing the unsustainable and automatic growth of mandatory spending programs and extending tax relief to families and small businesses  we have successfully accomplished the first two   now  this rule will provide for consideration of our final commitment to american taxpayers  extending numerous important tax relief provisions   in 2001  2003 and 2004  congr,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i would remind the gentleman that amt relief is not in our package because it passed yesterday in the house by a vote of 4144   that is why it is not in this package  because it passed yesterday   we all talk about what we do here in washington as it relates to the economy   the bottom line is that the economy is doing quite well because americans are out there working hard every day   a lot of them are getting up before the sun co,1
addressing the gentleman s concerns  yesterday 414 members of the house voted for amt relief   i am unclear which piece of that the gentleman is referring to that the democrats had that paid for that as it relates to that   and the gentleman  in reference to his concern about the deficit  which is legitimate and shared by all of us about the growth of the deficit  failed to point out that the deficit has gone down over  100 billion in the last year   the size of the us deficit dropped,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   recognizing that volume does not always make up for sound policy  i would just pose the question as to why the democratic substitute leaves out many of the people that the gentleman purported to speak for   the democratic substitute does not include the savers credit for low income families  those low income families who are contributing to iras and pension plans  scrimping and saving every day  every week  every month to put aside,1
i have one remaining speaker as well   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  the debate here has been consumed by the discussion of capital gains and dividends  and that is a big part of this and that is appropriate   but the amt relief component  which has been the source of much recent debate  we dealt with yesterday   we dealt with it on a vote of 4144  overwhelming  bipartisan  on the suspension calendar  which i will remind members under the rule  requires a twothirds vote to pass   it,1
mr speaker  the gentleman picked a heck of a time to lose his voice here now   ,0
i am terribly sorry   i will take it up then when we have the opportunity   ,0
mr speaker  i do not want to get technical about this   i just want to set the record straight  and that is that we all agree that the alternative minimum tax is an unfair tax on people because it was not planned by the ways and means committee and by the congress   so  of course  we thought yesterday and we think today that these people  who through inflation were thrown into this category  should be protected   and that is why we were so disappointed that the republicans  by party l,0
mr speaker  i welcome the opportunity to join with the republicans to send this holiday message to millions of americans that will be affected by this bill  especially to the fraction of 1 percent that would be the beneficiaries of a substantial reduction in capital gains and corporate dividends   it is true  while this only represents 20 to 25 percent of the bill  it should be made abundantly clear that these benefits would not be effective until sometime in 2009 and 2010   now  i am he,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  i would just like to say briefly  if the chairman of the ways and means committee is saying that the alternative minimum tax is in the other body s bill  then he must be saying that the tax cuts that we are talking about today are not in the other body s bill   so it is 3card molly   the house republicans passed both of them  one on the suspension calendar that is not protected here  but is protected in the other b,0
mr speaker  i would like to ask the gentleman just one question on my time   these very important tax cuts or extension of tax cuts you are talking about  could you share with me as simply as possible as to when they expire  what year   ,0
the tax cut that we are talking about is the  20 billion in capital gains and corporate dividends   does that not expire in 2009   do nt get rattled   ,0
it is just a simple question   because there seems to be some degree of urgency in this and unless it is a projected gift  then these things do nt expire this year or next year   ,0
please   ,0
i think the gentleman has answered the question   there is no urgency in this   you just want to give a projected christmas gift to the very wealthy   so i need some help on this   if i ca nt get answers from you  i will get someone that can give answers   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i am so glad to hear my friend from florida talk about the economic growth that we can expect by making certain that the capital gains tax cut and the corporate dividend tax cut do not expire   what bewilders most people is that this does not expire until 2008   nobody would be adversely affected until 2009  and unless the gentleman does not believe he will be in the majority in the next few years  i do not see why he would have to s,0
mr speaker  i had an old law professor  and he once told me  if you do nt have the facts going for you  raise your voice   i never understood it  but i do now   ,0
mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time  having only one speaker remaining  until the other side reaches that point   ,0
mr speaker  i continue to reserve the balance of my time   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  we have now come to the conclusion of this debate  and i want my colleagues to know that if you are looking for some of the things that are worthwhile that are in the majority s bill  we have an opportunity in the substitute to take care of it   but if you really believe this is the time for america to give a  20 billion tax cut to these people who will not be affected until 2009  why would they want to give this incentiv,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  we have a democrat substitute that really is not in sharp conflict with the republican bill   many things we tried and include and did suggest in the brief time we had to work on this bill   basically  what we have done  though  is to pay more attention to the middle class that really are the victims of the alternative minimum tax than we pay attention to the richest of america who do not find their republican tax cuts,0
there must be some chart around to show how many people were pushed into poverty during that same period of time and our wages have been reduced  but we have it in the back if any of our members would like to use it   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i have all the respect for the majority leader  and it is true that he knows some of these people that have gone from upper middle income to become higherincome people  and there are other people in this country that have seen middleincome people slip into the rolls of poverty   so in order to have a more wellbalanced bill  we concentrated on the middle class by putting the alternative minimum tax into this bill to make certain th,0
mr speaker  i agree with my distinguished friend from new york  mr reynolds   that the republicans did send a signal to protect the alternative minimum tax   we want to do a lot more   ,0

mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
i am  mr speaker   ,0
well  mr speaker  you can take away our right to go to conference  our right to amend bills  but one thing you can not take away is our right to vote   we have a game called 3 card molly in new york   you never know which one is under the shell   so they have an opportunity to say that they want to help the wealthiest americans  but they like to give a whole lot of talk to those people who  through no fault of their own  except the ineptness and the inability of the republicans to cor,0
mr speaker  on that  i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from michigan for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise today in strong support of hr 4297  the tax relief extension reconciliation act of 2005  and in opposition to the democrat substitute   mr speaker  the ways and means bill before us today addresses a number of important priorities that are broadly supported by members on both sides of the aisle   these include tax savings for higher education expenses  small business tax relief  tax ince,1
mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to hr 4297  the tax reconciliation bill   cutting taxes for the super rich  and ignoring the needs of the poor and middle class  as this bill does  is a dangerous deviation from fiscal and moral responsibility   as with every american  i too would like to see my taxes cut   therefore my opposition to this bill does not stem from a deepseated hostility toward the concept of tax cuts   rather  my opposition is a plain and simple recognit,0
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman yielding me time   i also appreciate the fact that the gentleman from washington is willing to acknowledge christmas here on the house floor   that is a nice step in the right direction   mr speaker  let us look at the facts   to hear the other side  you would think we were taking a chain saw to the budget   what we are proposing in the budget is that we increase entitlement spending 63 percent instead of 64 percent  saving  50 billion out of ,1
each of these tax cuts expire between this year and the next 2 years   it depends on the tax cut you are talking about   ,1
not at all   ,1
if the gentleman will allow me to respond to his question   ,1
why is it important that we continue the tax relief progress that would expire in 2008 on dividends and capital gains   because those are job creators   ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from michigan for yielding me this time   i have been listening to the debate here on the floor   i have yet to hear anybody from the other side say that the reduction in capital gains does not stimulate the economy or say that any of these items are bad for the economy   all we have heard from the other side is class warfare  who is getting what   well  i can tell you who is getting what  and we can go down this thing   my folks in florida want to be ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   very briefly  since the tax rate on capital gains and dividends was reduced in may of 2003  the economy has grown at an average rate of 41 percent  44 million new jobs have been created  government tax receipts have increased 10 percent annually   now we are coming to a situation in 2008 where the capital gains rate is going to go up to 20 percent  dividends go back to ordinary income   what effect is this going to have on,1

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   i would like to urge a `` no  vote on the rule  a `` no  vote on the bill  and say to every member of the house of representatives if they want the amt fix protected  the only way in the world they can do it today is to vote for the democrat substitute   ,0
mr speaker  over the last few days we have seen a flurry of tax cuts on the house floor  three yesterday  another one  a big one  today   and over the last 6 months  four other bills have been enacted that have tax cuts and concessions built into them  for example  the energy policy act   by breaking all of those tax cuts into small pieces and by burying them in other bills  not tax bills  the audit trail very quickly becomes hard to follow   it is hard to see the forest for the tr,0
mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to hr 4297  yet another tax break for the richest among us at the expense of those who have the least   the republicans want to cut taxes by  945 billion   how do they pay for these cuts   before thanksgiving they voted to cut  50 billion from programs that help the poorest americans   the conclusion is obvious  they are paying for the tax cuts for wealthy americans by cutting programs for working americans   under the tax break package,0
mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   last night  about 12  000 mississippians went to bed in somebody else s house or in their carport or in their car or in their tent   they are waiting on a fema trailer   i did not promise them a fema trailer   the president of the united states did   he has not fulfilled that promise yet   it is over 102 days past the storm   as we speak  there are tens of thousands of mississippians  average joes  who are about to lose thei,0
mr speaker  i want to remind the gentleman that when your house is washed away  your job is washed away   you are not looking for a tax break   you are looking for your fellow americans to help you out while your kids are serving in the mississippi national guard over in iraq   you have not done that for 102 days   ,0
well  i guess we are going to be telling christmas stories   rather than fiction  i would rather deal with fact   yesterday 414 members of the house voted to assist a group who  on average  are far richer than those who receive dividends and cap gains   there were four no votes   all four of them were on the democratic side of the aisle   and i respect those people for casting what i believe was a sincere vote   but out of the 188 democrats who voted aye  i just have to point out that,1
mr speaker  will the gentleman yield   i thought the gentlewoman from new york indicated she had one final speaker  and that final speaker spoke  mr pomeroy   ,1
i was asking the gentlewoman from new york   ,1
notwithstanding the equal time  mr speaker  if the gentlewoman says it is a final speaker  we normally honor that   ,1

mr speaker  this is a bill that does not deserve the kind of rhetoric that is being delivered so far  at least that which i have heard on the rule   this bill consists of extending current tax provisions   it virtually breaks no new ground   it merely retains those structures supported in committee  for example  in a bipartisan way  to allow people to continue to utilize current tax privileges   i have a hard time when i listen to the rhetoric associated with the description of this bi,1
mr speaker  i yield myself 30 seconds   mr speaker  perhaps the gentleman from new york  mr rangel   is not aware that the senate has included the alternative minimum tax in their reconciliation tax package   they have already voted on it   so there is no need to provide any assurance from the house side  because the senate has already included it   but  again  that is reality   the economy is not good because the president told us so   leading economic indicators tell us so  th,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume to ask a rhetorical question   if the gentleman from massachusetts  mr neal   voted yes on this alternative minimum tax bill yesterday he either was protecting the very rich in massachusetts   ,1
no  it is a rhetorical question   ,1
whose time is it  mr speaker   ,1
either he was voting to protect the incomes of the very rich in massachusetts or he exercised a futile procedure   there were four members of his party who voted no   he had an opportunity  if he believed it was not real to vote no   he voted yes   the problem is they always want it both ways   ,1
mr speaker  actually  i do not need 12 minutes  i only need 10 seconds   this bill is a   ,1
no   ,1
mr speaker  who has the time   ,1
mr speaker  it is obvious the gentleman from new york wants to make sure you do not hear this   as i said  you do not need 12 minutes to say this  if you vote `` yes  for the democrat substitute  you are increasing taxes over 5 years by  40 billion   that is the single largest tax increase since they were in the majority in 1993   ,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit   ,1
mr speaker  i do not need to mention yesterday or the 414 who voted to fix this problem   i would tell my friend from new york that you only need 60 votes outside of a reconciliation to pass this   but i do want to mention 1985   the tax reform act of 1985  under their watch  said this  `` other regular tax itemized deductions such as those for state and local taxes paid and for certain investment expenses  are not allowed for minimum tax purposes  i assume they did that knowingly  ,1
i thank the gentleman for yielding   mr speaker  just 2 weeks ago  the majority came down to the floor and cut  50 billion from services for middleclass workers  students  hungry children  farmers  and single moms   today  they are back with part two  pushing almost  60 billion in tax breaks for americans who need help the least   sadly  they are trying to peddle this as deficit reduction   mr speaker  you can not spend  10 billion more than you cut and call it deficit reduct,0
mr speaker  i support hr 4297  the tax relief extension reconciliation act  which provides extensions for incentives for brownfields remediation  a vital tool for national economic growth and for our nation s cities   i want to echo the comments of my colleague  jerry weller  and applaud his efforts for supporting the remediation of brownfields   brownfields are found in every state and in every congressional district   estimates range from 500  000 to 1 million brownfields sites a,1
mr speaker  as we debate this bill  we must remember it is only part of a brew based on the republican leadership s budget recipe   just before thanksgiving  they twisted enough arms to put the first ingredients into the mixing bowl by passing a bill to cut more than  50 billion over five years from medicaid  student loans  and many other programs of great importance to millions of americans   today  they want to continue by adding some good things  including extensions of welltarg,0
mr speaker  today we are presented with act ii of the republican majority s ongoing and tragically misguided reconciliation saga   in act i  we learned who the majority felt most deserved to bear the brunt of their spending cuts  poor citizens who rely on medicaid  hungry people who turn to food stamps and families trying to afford college   now in act ii we are learning where they propose that money go  for tax breaks  that are targeted primarily to benefit the top 1  of the wealthie,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time  and for his leadership on this issue as well as many others   it is good to be in the house doing something that is pretty basic   i support this legislation   i would note that if you vote `` no   you are actually voting to increase taxes because this is legislation simply extending current law that expires in the coming year   i also want to point out a provision that is very  very important in districts like mine  in are,1
if the gentleman will yield for just a moment  i appreciate the gentleman s insight and expertise because it really crystallizes so importantly the correct way to view tax relief and deficits   this is a chart i know the gentleman is familiar with  and it shows the current deficit that we have and it shows a decreasing deficit  in fact  a significantly decreasing deficit  with the deficit declining  138 billion   that is  138 billion in the last 18 months  and that is at the same time,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentlewoman s pointing out the increase in tax revenue and the gentleman from texas pointing that out  because it is lost on some folks   it was not lost on president kennedy  by the way  nor was it lost on president reagan  who understood clearly that if you decrease tax rates for individuals and corporations  what happens is that the economy becomes vibrant   it becomes enthusiastic in its zeal   and what happens is that you increase tax revenue   this ,1
if the gentlewoman will yield  i want to get this straight  because i think it is incredibly important for the american people to understand what is going to happen this week in the house   as i heard the gentlewoman say  if an individual in this chamber votes `` no  on hr 4297  that means that they want to see the american people not be able to deduct sales tax  state and local sales tax   ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentlewoman pointing out some of the specific provisions of hr 4297 that we will be dealing with tomorrow   i served in the georgia state legislature  and we worked for years to try to get tax deductibility for teachers for their outofpocket expenses   i do not know a single teacher that does not spend some of their own money to kind of fill the hole  to provide some of those items in the classroom  especially in the elementary grades  that make so much m,1
mr speaker  there are a couple of other items that are included  and one that i want to highlight is the 2year extension on the reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends   it is so incredibly important for americans to understand and appreciation that if a member of congress votes no on this provision  it means that they do not want to extend that tax rate decrease on capital gains and dividends  which is so incredibly important and vital for small businesses  as the gentleman fro,1
mr speaker  i rise to express my opposition to the irresponsible tax reconciliation bill the house passed earlier today   i strongly support tax relief  but i oppose this bill because it does not target tax relief to middle class families  because it is paid for by slashing health care and education programs and because it will needlessly increase our national debt   mr speaker  this tax bill is the second half of a misguided budget reconciliation package that raids the wallets of my wes,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman from tennessee  mrs blackburn   for yielding   i want to reiterate what our colleague from georgia has said   we are grateful to you for the leadership you have provided in these special orders in trying to get the truth out about the issues   our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to think that by saying things that are not true  they can make them true   i am glad that we have an opportunity to correct the record   mr speaker  this p,1
mr speaker  as we begin debate on additional tax cuts  hr 4297  we must consider them in the larger context of the challenges this nation is facing and the impact these tax cuts will have  on our ability to face these challenges as well as future challenges   our decisions must always prioritize protecting the future of this nation for our children and their children   over the thanksgiving recess  i participated in a program in my district that sought to increase early literacy by i,0
mr speaker  i want to put this debate in some perspective   it was a year ago this week that the commission that the united states congress created gave their report to us  after spending approximately  10 million of the taxpayers  money to put the report together  a year ago   this debate is about how we spend another year before we do anything  and that is wrong   what is lacking here is leadership   the ocean issue goes back generations   it goes back to the last administration  ,0

can we have a hearing on it   ,0
i have not seen any of that  and i am one of the cosponsors of that bill   the oceans blueprint for the 21st century is the report that we spent  10 million on   the bill to implement that is called oceans21   this task force  the caucus  have all been bipartisan  have been equally split   but if you want to look at it  this task force is not only a delay tactic  it is also a very partisan tactic   the task force  for no apparent reason  will have seven republican members and only,0
mr speaker  i want to thank mr hastings  for helping bring this legislation to the floor  and i want to thank him for yielding the time   i will speak now for a few minutes explaining the legislation  and i would hope  mr speaker  that we can have a bipartisan vote to move this task force along so that the myriad of issues that cover a broad range of committee assignments  both on the house and the senate side  and a broad array of federal departments and agencies can be viewed with a,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i would just like to respond to my colleague on the other side of the aisle   this issue did not pop up out of thin air   my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know full well that we have been working on this   we have had numerous  numerous conversations since last may on this particular task force   leon panetta  who headed the pew ocean policy commission s report  is in favor of this task force   admiral watkins  who ,1

mr speaker  i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on this legislation and include extraneous material thereon   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself as much time as i may consume   mr speaker  house resolution 599 will establish a house task force on ocean policy with the express purpose of developing recommendations and reporting to the house on the findings of the united states commission on ocean policy by june 2006   this bipartisan task force will have members appointed by the speaker and minority leader who will focus on the final report of the united states commission on ocean policy entitled  `` an o,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to this resolution for many of the reasons that my colleagues have cited   the fact of the matter is  we have the blueprint for what needs to be done on the oceans    10 million was spent developing it   we have another one from the private sector  from the pew foundation  led by our former colleague leon panetta   i think they spent over  4 million   the resources committee has a budget of  14 million   if there are five other committees  most of ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman from california for yielding me this time  and i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  in 2003 the pew ocean policy commission put out a comprehensive report telling us that our oceans were in serious trouble   the republican leadership quickly ignored the report  saying they wanted to wait for the results of the congressionally appointed us commission on ocean policy   and lo and behold  last september that commission came to the s,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 30 seconds   mr speaker  as one point of clarification regarding the claim made by the gentleman  our chairman  that no select committee was formed to consider the stratton commission recommendations  i believe that the gentleman from maryland was in fact wrong on that   the senate specifically established a national ocean policy study in the commerce committee for that purpose   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  again  i think it is very important that we vote no on this resolution   essentially  it is going to accomplish nothing   i said before that  when mr hastings  who is the sponsor  first spoke earlier today  he said that the task force will have no legislative jurisdiction   if you read section 3  jurisdiction  under the resolution  it specifically says  the task force may develop recommendations and report to the ,0
mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
mr speaker  i rise to express my opposition to this resolution   this ocean policy task force resolution  while well intentioned by its sponsor  is misguided   its effect would be to deceive the american public into believing that the house of representatives is actually working to advance the recommendations of two comprehensive ocean policy reports when the opposite is true   as the ranking democratic member on the committee on resources  i staunchly support efforts to restore our ocea,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise today in support of the resolution to create a house ocean task force   during the more than 20 years i have been here in the congress  i have made it a priority to promote protection of our oceans and effective conservation and management of the living marine resources   from protecting coastal wetlands to cleaning up our estuaries to promoting sustainable fisheries to preventing ocean pollution  each has ,1
mr speaker  i would just like to point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle that mr gilchrest  has spent a great deal of time in working with leadership on this issue  recognizing that there is a process problem here in that the oceans21 bill that we all want to see passed is in the jurisdiction of quite some number of committees   for example  the agriculture committee has jurisdiction with regard to issues involving runoff   the armed services committee has obvious jurisdic,1
mr speaker  as the saying goes  it is time for a lot less talk and a lot more action   the other side of the aisle talks a good game on protecting our oceans  but they control the resources committee   they control the house floor schedule   they control this congress   and what have they done   at any time  they can use the house resources committee to bring up legislation to protect the oceans  but they have yet to have hearings or move legislation on marine protected areas  region,0
mr speaker  strange things happen around this place when we are getting ready for recess   legislation just seems to come out of the woodwork sometimes  like the resolution on the suspension calendar today   the bill before us today would spend  400  000 of taxpayer money to establish a house task force on ocean policy   quite simply  it is duplicative and wasteful   there is already a standing house committee to deal with ocean policy that professional staff already have in place   t,0
mr speaker  i am going to vote to send this bill along to the conference and vote `` yes  for two reasons  first  i think the bill very wisely includes relief for multiemployer plans  an issue that many of us have worked on for a very long period of time   these are plans run by small businesses who find large contributions to be very stifling to their ability to compete   i think this relief is long overdue  and it is the principle reason that i will vote to send the bill along to co,1

mr speaker  i appreciate my colleague from washington for yielding me this time   and i appreciate the concern that my colleague from massachusetts has raised   now  if this bill was as bad as the gentleman has tried to define it  why would we bring it to the floor   why would any member of this house seek to bring a bill to the floor that would hurt american workers   ,1
madam speaker  pursuant to house resolution 602  i call up the bill  hr 2830  to amend the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code of 1986 to reform the pension funding rules  and for other purposes  and ask for its immediate consideration   ,1
madam speaker  i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on hr 2830   ,1
madam speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   madam speaker  i will put this as bluntly as i can  our nation s pension laws are outdated and broken and placing at risk the retirement security of millions of american workers   today  we have an opportunity to change this by voting for the most comprehensive reforms to worker pension laws in more than a generation   the pension protection act is the outcome of one of the most thorough and remarkable legislative processes i hav,1
i will be happy to do so   mr price of georiga   as you and i are both aware  the airline industry continues to amass losses as the industry strives to become more dynamic  both externally and internally   losses during the last 4 years have proven that the business model used by legacy carriers is outdated but under duress by highfuel prices and post911 repercussions   a primary component playing into the equation of legacy carrier viability is the pension systems currently in place ,1

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   as i listen to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  i have to tell you that i am confused   some of them say the rules that we are proposing here are too tough and are going to drive employers out of the pension business  while we have some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying the rules are not tight enough and we are going to create more deficits at the pension benefit guaranty corporation   ladies and gentlem,1
let me thank my colleague and my friend and classmate  mr camp  for yielding me time  and thank all of my colleagues for what i think has been a very healthy debate today about how we strengthen america s pension system   we have heard members argue that the bill that we are bringing before us is too difficult  that we will force companies out of pension plans and leave their employees hanging  while others have argued that the rules are not tough enough  and we are keeping the door ope,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit   ,1
mr speaker  the debate today on the floor is about the massive underfunding in worker pensions and the need to change the status quo   unfortunately  what we have just been presented is what would actually make pensions less secure by preserving the status quo and putting at risk millions of american pensions   let me make five points   first  the motion to recommit preserves the status quo by requiring employers and union leaders to fund their plans at 90 percent or in some cases only 80,1

mr speaker  i yield myself 30 seconds just to say that we had several hearings on this pension bill in the ways and mean committee  including the select revenue subcommittee which i chair   let me just say that the pbgc s analysis shows that funding contributions to this end up being lower only in the short term  but  actually  starting in 2010  contributions to pension plans will increase   and that is because the funding reforms in the bill are phased in over 5 years   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   ,1
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  i would just say to the gentleman  as chairman of the select revenue measures subcommittee of ways and means  i look forward to working with him on this and other issues as this legislation moves through the process and to conference   ,1
mr speaker  i yield myself 2 minutes   mr speaker  pension reform is more than just an accounting issue  it is about protecting the trust between employers and their employees   it is critical for congress to address this issue and step in and fix rules that no longer work   many businesses are complying with pension laws   however  the current system is too weak  and many companies have plans that are underfunded   it is time for congress to step in and reform singleemployer pensio,1
mr speaker  i thank the distinguished chairman for yielding   i oppose the motion to recommit   this motion to recommit leaves current pension funding rules in place which ends up weakening the funding rules in the underlying bill   this means that businesses would not be fulfilling their promises to working people   the motion to recommit also has a  53 billion surtax contained in it on small business   that surtax is bad for workers  bad for small business  bad for america   so i wo,1

mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0
mr speaker  first let me yield myself 30 seconds to point out that i wish we did have provisions in this bill to deal with the airline industry  because i think we should   the problem is that we do not  and we go to conference with a situation where those who have wellfunded plans are now likely to be asked to pay because of the costs of the airline industry   and let me also point out from mr boehner s comment about making the pbgc better funded  if we have a lot of terminated plans ,0

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  i am sure that people who are watching this debate are somewhat confused about some of the technical provisions that we have talked about on the funding of a guaranteed fund   but let me try to simplify it   the bottom line is that the total changes that are being suggested make it more rigid and less predictable for those companies that have traditional pension plans as to how much money they have to put into the guaranteed ,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   i would like to offer my support also for the comprehensive pension reform legislation that we are now considering   i would also like to congratulate and thank chairman boehner and chairman thomas for their hard work in getting us to a point where we can make meaningful and necessary reforms to our pension system   it has become very clear to us that the laws governing pension plans are antiquated   this is evident from recent ,1
mr speaker  it is because of today s outdated pension rules  workers  retirees and taxpayers all stand to lose unless we act now to reform our pension system   under current law  employers have been allowed to underestimate their future pension liabilities and to make promises they simply can not keep   the recent example of united airlines underscores the need for reform   united pilots plan was severely underfunded  yet the company was not required to make cash contributions to that ,1

mr speaker  i particularly want to commend the chairs of the ways and means and education and the workforce committees for putting together a bill which could finally fix the antiquated laws that govern pension plans and protect  at the same time  the interests of workers  retirees  and taxpayers   what comprehensive pension reform must do and what this bill does for the first time in a generation is to significantly shore up pension funds through tough funding rules  but without pushing,1
mr speaker  i thank the subcommittee chairman  mr camp  and my colleagues for working so hard on this bill  along with our chairman and chairman of the education and the workforce committee   without their urging  this bill would not be on the floor today  and this bill is so extremely important  especially to constituents in my district   over the last year  i have met with employees  union members  covered by both multiemployer and singleemployer plans  also with the employers,1

mr speaker  i rise to express my opposition to the pension reform legislation that we are considering today   i oppose this legislation because it will further erode an employer s willingness to provide defined benefit plans and will close the loopholes that allow companies to dump their pension obligations on to taxpayers   throughout the 1990 s  in american workplaces a dramatic shift from traditional definedbenefit plans to definedcontribution plans occurred   rather than being able,0
mr speaker  i have to join the gentleman from massachusetts on his concern and dismay  frustration  and i think that outrage that the opportunity for a democratic substitute  first of all  to express some of the failures of this particular underlying bill and as well the opportunities to improve this legislation seemingly has been denied   i speak from a particularly unique perspective  mr speaker  because my district contained enron  and the thousands of employees that  within hours,0

mr speaker  i believe that section 122 of this bill is an important public policy statement that says corporate executives who are not properly funding the pension plans of their employees should not be feathering their own nests with overly generous retirement packages   currently  the bill penalizes employers who fund executive compensation if the sponsor s employee defined plans are less than 60 percent funded   my concern is that by setting this threshold too low  we are not discourag,1

mr speaker  i mostly want to talk about substance   but you know it is so hypocritical for anybody on the majority side to come here and say that the minority is just saying no when you will not allow us to put on the floor a substitute to which we want to say a resounding yes   that is really hypocrisy   this is too important a subject to be governed by the tyranny of the majority   we need to strengthen and to save defined benefit plans in this country   this is the question   will thi,0

madam speaker  this bill proves that the republicans are not just after poor people   this pension bill boils down to one fundamental principle  the republicans want all americans  including flight attendants and everybody else out there on a pension  to be entirely alone  isolated from the strength and compassion of american values   i am here to say that this pension bill that forces elderly americans into solitary confinement is abusive  irresponsible and morally bankrupt   this whol,0
well  let me thank my colleague from florida for that eloquent and accurate statement and assessment of where we are here   ,0
madam speaker  millions of americans who work in the private sector are relying on having an employersponsored pension plan when they retire   an important part of the american dream is to have a nest egg that people can tap into during their golden years so that they are not forced to literally work until they die   american workers have fought for and earned the right to pay into a pension system that will provide an income once they retire   unfortunately  there are serious problems wit,0

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   the gentleman from indiana tells us we should all be happy because the education committee deliberated on this and there were votes in that committee   i should remind the gentleman that there are 49 members of the education committee   there are 435 members of the house of representatives   the gentleman gets all upset when mr miller  talks about the fact that it is important for us to be an example to iraq about what democracy is ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   let me just again say to the gentleman from south carolina who just spoke  what we are asking for here is an opportunity to offer what we think is best   we disagree with you   we disagree with your approach   not only do we disagree with your approach  the aarp disagrees with your approach   aarp  december 12  2005   dear representative  aarp is writing to express its opposition to a number of critical elements of hr 2830  ,0
i can say why do you bring most of the bills that you bring to the floor that i think adversely impact american workers  from repealing worker protections and worker benefits   ,0
mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
madam speaker  i rise in strong support of hr 2830  and i thank chairmen boehner and thomas and johnson for their great work in getting us to this point   this bill represents a responsible approach that will protect the retirement benefits of millions of american workers and help ensure that their pension benefits will be there when they retire   in recent years  our important retirement security system has come under strain from the increased aging of the workforce and from dishonest em,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to the pension protection act of 2005   this act does not protect the american worker   in fact  this bill places the future of today s american worker in jeopardy   even worse  this bill places those who have put in the years and worked hard at the mercy of bad management decisions   furthermore  pensions are a financial safety net that many americans and businesses pay into   pension programs are an important factor when workers choose a job a,0
mr speaker  when this issue first came to the floor  i was very concerned  certainly  about how it dealt with some of our manufacturing companies and our workers as well   so many people in my district have worked a lifetime to secure a good pension to help them in their retirement years   they perform jobs that are difficult on them  both physically and mentally  and they have earned their pension   in michigan we have so many workers in the airline industry  because  of course  de,1
madam speaker  i yield myself 5 minutes   madam speaker  when we are starting to deal with the pension plans that protect america s retirements  one of the things we should do is to make a decision not to do any harm   but the fact of the matter is that this bill makes things worse in many ways for many pensioners in this country and many future pensioners   first and foremost  we created the pension benefit guaranty corporation to be there to protect some of the retiree benefits of peop,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 3 minutes   mr speaker  when united airlines announced it was going to go into bankruptcy  the democratic members of the committee on education and the workforce planned an ehearing so those people who were most affected by the termination of that plan and the bankruptcy of that company would have an opportunity to talk to their representatives in congress   we were not going to have a hearing on this problem  and these people could not come to washington and ,0
yes  i am  mr speaker  in its present form   ,0
mr speaker  we offer this motion to recommit to address a number of issues that are not addressed in the legislation before us and to hopefully not do some of the things that the legislation before us does   we believe that we can do these things without driving employers out of the defined benefit system   the current bill before us provides a compilation of interest rates and premium fees and costs that we believe will drive employers to accelerate the termination and freezing of these pla,0
mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
mr speaker  as the consumer listens to this debate  one of the things i believe that they want to understand is that the advocates of this legislation  they are the ones that  just a year ago  were trying to privatize the social security system   they wanted to privatize the social security system   that should not be dismissed   so this bill is now shuttled to the floor  barely a word of consideration in the ways and means committee  and the republicans on the rules committee would n,0
mr speaker  i rise in strong support of the pension protection act  hr 2830   legislation that responds to the many challenges currently facing the financial health of the defined benefit pension system   the defined benefit system provides millions of american retirees and current workers with retirement benefits earned over the course of a lifetime   yet the rules governing the structure of the defined benefit system are geared towards a 20th century workforce that no longer exists  ,1
madam speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   madam speaker  i see the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce is in the chamber   i want to give him initially a compliment   that committee has had a number of hearings   i believe the gentleman has wrestled with this issue  and i believe he has come up with a deeply flawed solution  but i give him credit for an initial effort   now on the other hand the chairman deserves much rebuke for tolerating the,0
mr speaker  there are two major problems with this bill   the first is that it costs  70 billion and the costs are not paid for  not offset anywhere   it drives the deficit deeper   last week  this chamber voted to deal with the amt 1year fix   31 billion   the majority voted to pass a budget reconciliation that added another  56 billion in deficit   this adds an additional  70 billion in deficit    177 billion in deeper deficits   you know  it is christmastime   people are t,0
mr speaker  i strongly support this important legislation to address pending funding issues for america s workers  and i applaud the work of chairman thomas and chairman boehner on this bill   as my friend from north dakota  on the other side of the aisle  just pointed out  relief for the pension plans of america s struggling airlines is not in the current house bill   certainly important to my district  but i have been assured  mr speaker  that as this bill moves to conference wit,1
madam speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   my colleagues  i do not know how the majority gets away with what they do   i do not think that their legislative initiatives are just for the legislation  but rather to do away with traditions that have existed under democrat administrations   if you have an immigration problem  lock up the immigrants and lock up the employers   if you have a health problem  then get rid of medicaid and medicare and let the private sector resol,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to hr 2830  the socalled pension protection act   it should be pointed out that hr 2830 is opposed by aarp  by the pension rights center  and pension advocates across the country   while i recognize that the republican leadership included some modest provisions to attract some union support  hr 2830 still has a number of provisions that will jeopardize the retirement security o,0
mr speaker  i rise to urge my colleagues to vote `` yes  on this important piece of legislation for several reasons   paramount  it will help an industry that badly needs our help at a very critical time  and the only way we can help the airline industry is to get it into conference   there are a lot of things that may be right with this bill  there a lot of things that may be wrong with this bill  but the only answer and the logical and most responsible thing that we need to do is to ,1
mr speaker  i rise again in support of this important legislation   i wanted to get down to this  well  to kind of deal with some specifics as to why it is important that we move this bill on over into conference   first of all  this is a comprehensive pension reform bill that will protect workers  retirement incomes   it will give companies a longer window to make underfunded plans whole  and it will help protect us taxpayers from taking on the liability associated with future plan ,1
mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to hr 2830  which would be better titled the republican pension destruction act   american workers deserve much better than a bill that will reduce employee pensions and provide incentives for employers to break pension promises to employees   recent bankruptcies in the airline industry shed a bright light on exactly what big corporations are up to   a few months ago  united airlines dumped its flight attendant pension program onto the pensi,0
madam speaker  i appreciate the chairman rising to engage me in a colloquy   i would like to thank both you and chairman thomas for your work on this bill   as you remember  back during the committee  i spoke about shutdown benefits and appreciate the work that you and chairman thomas have done in the last couple of days to deal with stakeholders in that industry   however  the language contained in the bill does not quite go far enough  i believe  in helping everybody in every industry,1
mr speaker  i rise today in opposition to hr 2830   i am old enough to remember a time when everyone on my block in the glen park section of gary  indiana had a pension   the defined benefit pension system today  which protects the retirement security of over 44 million workers  retirees  and their families  is at a critical juncture   the number of defined benefit plans has declined from over 100  000 in 1985 to under 32  000 in 2004   while the number of active workers covered b,0
madam speaker  i rise in support of this rule and the underlying bill   i believe this piece of legislation is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will take up in the 109th congress  and i do not believe it is getting an adequate level of public attention considering the enormity of the significance   in my 11 years in the house of representatives  i have seen more and more the movement of our economy into a global economy where our us corporations are increasingly fin,1

madam speaker  american workers know that a defined pension plan is a promise from their employer  a promise that  when they retire  they will receive a benefit they can rely on   in fact  they have planned their retirement future on that promise   this bill allows companies to break that promise   it allows companies to switch midstream to cash balance plans  ignoring that promise to their workers   these workers have trusted that this benefit will be there   it will be there at the ,0
madam speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time to address both the rule and the bill   madam speaker  i rise in support of the rule and the bill   and frankly  i never cease to be amazed by some of the discussion from the other side  for oftentimes they accurately identify the problem  and then completely ignore the solution   madam speaker  traditional pension plans once the legacy of a lifetime of work are crumbling   they are crumbling   we are able to bring this bi,1

mr speaker  i rise in strong support of this rule and the pension protection act   over the past several years  we have all witnessed some disturbing occurrences as we have seen far too many hardworking americans contribute money into a pension plan  only to find their benefits dwindle or depleted entirely   we must find ways to ensure that employers keep their promises to their retiring workers   i believe we have done so in this bill   chairman boehner and thomas are to be applauded fo,1
mr speaker  like the president s wishful  staged declaration of `` mission accomplished  on that aircraft carrier 2 12 years ago  or the vice president s declaration that the insurgency was in its `` final throes   this resolution proclaims the desire of congress for `` victory  in iraq   instead of dispatching our troops in adequate numbers  this congress made one speech after another   instead of covering our troops with adequate  impenetrable armor  this congress passed one,0

mr speaker  given the stated interest in democracy here in the house  i would ask unanimous consent to amend the rule to permit for division of the question so that we could express our unanimous support for the various provisions of this resolution  except for that on which we have disagreement as to the best way to achieve success in iraq   at this point  so that we can have the kind of democracy that occurred this week in iraq  of which the majority seems so proud  and actually have i,0

mr speaker  as i listen to these statements made about public opinion polls  i would like to point to my colleagues the abc news poll about which my friend referred   seventyone percent of the iraqis polled said that their lives were very good or quite good  61 percent reported the security situation is very good or quite good in the area where they reside  64 percent said they expect their lives to be much or somewhat better a year from now   i know that my friend from ohio is introduci,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume to respond to my very good friend from california by saying  first and foremost  there is nothing ugly and divisive about the debate that we are about to undertake  that we are in the midst of right now  number one   number two  i think it is important to note that while all of the recommendations that were made by the minority were rejected  i have just been given by the staff of the international relations committee an outline of t,1

absolutely   i look forward to it   ,1
will the gentleman yield   i have yielded 2 minutes to the gentleman   i think he still has time   i just would like to say that i believe that the resolution that has been brought forward is one which recognizes the directive  the call from the president of iraq   it recognizes the sense of the men and women in uniform who are on the ground there   and i believe that an overwhelming majority  and i will say to my friend  there may be some republicans who choose to vote against this meas,1

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i first say to my friend from texas  mr doggett   that this notion that we are going to stay just as long as president bush wants us to stay and not a day longer  well  actually  what president bush has said is that we will stay as long as necessary and not a day longer   and that was part of the initial strategy that was launched on his speech on the 26th of february 2003   and it is very  very clear that the president of iraq ,1
reclaiming my time  i will say that the president has said in that speech that we will remain in iraq as long as necessary and not 1 day longer   that is very clear to me  and so it is obvious   ,1

i thank my friend  the distinguished rules committee member from massachusetts  for yielding me time   last night i made the statement in the rules committee that i would not participate in the debate   i do not intend when the debate begins to have anything to say  and quite frankly if i had the wherewithal  i would ask my colleagues on the democratic side not to say anything as well   but i do know a little bit now  having served on the rules committee for a little while  about closed,0
mr speaker  in 20 seconds i put to the chair a simple question  if this resolution is so simple and noncontroversial  why did it come through the rules committee   and is it not true that mr lantos  resolution is also simple  and there was nothing to preclude the committee on rules from hearing the lantos matter  had you chosen   and are you not the greatest exemplar of not having closed rules  mr chairman   ,0
i thank the chairman for not answering my question   ,0
mr speaker  the odds of success in iraq are not enhanced by congress continuing to act as a rubber stamp for president bush   we need a change in strategic vision in iraq   this resolution says that setting a timetable somehow is a communist plot  but  in fact  the president himself set timetables in iraq when he set timetables to have transitional elections in iraq   he set timetables for elections because it focused the iraqis to demand performance  and that is what we should do in se,0
i thank my friend for yielding   mr speaker  i rise in sorrow  not in anger  because this morning could be a morning of unity and celebration and congratulations   yesterday in unprecedented numbers the people of iraq rejected the threats and intimidation of the terrorists and chose a new permanent national parliament  the first fully sovereign  elected democratic assembly in the history of iraq   this should be cause for celebration for the iraqi people  for our troops  the troops of,0

mr speaker  before i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california  mr lantos   to respond to what the chairman of the rules committee had said  let me make clear  nobody is talking about waving a white flag here   what we are talking about is trying to figure out a way to make a bad situation less bad   the polls have shown clearly that the majority of the iraqi people want us out of iraq   when a majority wants something  they usually get what they want  because that is what a de,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 2 minutes   mr speaker  to suggest that the rules committee respects a deliberative process in this house or that it is somehow democratic or receptive to alternative ideas  i think demonstrates to me that the chairman has pretty low standards when it comes to being inclusive   the bottom line is  on important issues  on important matters like this one  we are routinely shut out   i mean  the chairman may be on board with what the president is doing in iraq,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 1 12 minutes   mr speaker  the resolution we are debating today is an h res resolution   basically  this is just a sense of the congress   it is largely symbolic   one of the complaints that many of us on this side of the aisle  and i know some of the people on the republican side have as well  is that we kind of skirt around the real issue  which is what the policy is   staying as long as it is going to take  that is not a policy   that is a sound bi,0
mr speaker  regardless of how members of this house feel about the war in iraq  i think all of us want to congratulate the people of iraq for holding these historic elections and for getting out to vote despite the significant risks   we all want to congratulate our troops  but quite frankly  there is language in this bill that some of us consider inflammatory  that some of us strongly disagree with  and i would urge my colleagues to vote `` no  on the previous question so that we can ,0

mr chairman  i want to thank the chairman for agreeing to work with us on this issue of importance to new york   ,0
mr chairman  the question is when is the congress going to stop letting american businesses and workers down   it is time to roll up our sleeves and chart a path to economic freedom   it is time to govern   today the republicans again ask us to consider a bill with provisions that will make its mark by missing the mark   it inflates government bureaucracy and deflates workers  opportunity   american business needs the best  most qualified workers on earth  but this bill does nothing to,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i would just say to the gentleman who just spoke that we believe that there are many religious organizations  many faithbased organizations that do incredible work  and they will still be able to do incredible work   what we object to  quite frankly  is the use of taxpayers  money to basically subsidize discrimination   ,0
mr chairman  i rise in strong support of hr 27 and thank the gentleman from ohio for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor  the job training improvement act of 2005  which i introduced to strengthen and reauthorize the nation s job training system as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs   job training programs must be responsive to the needs of the workforce and improving them is critical   in today s knowledgebased economy  we need to equip amer,1

mr chairman  i yield myself 2 minutes   mr chairman  we keep hearing that we are discriminating against religious organizations in terms of participation in government contracts   that is not true   the fact is that they can participate   when you talk about a barrier  say what the barrier is   the barrier is  there is a level playing field  you can not discriminate   we have also heard a lot about the 1964 civil rights act   what has not been said is since 1965 there has been a sp,0

mr chairman  i demand a recorded vote   ,0
mr chairman  i rise today in opposition to hr 27  the socalled job training improvement act of 2005   today s bill has nothing to do with improving job training for our workforce  far from it   instead  this bill actually weakens worker protections  opens the door to hiring discrimination  and dismantles the employment service program that helps unemployed workers find jobs   apparently the republicans have nt monitored the weak job market numbers   how else can you explain bein,0
mr chairman  i thank the chairman very much   this is an example of the collegiality of our committee on education and the workforce   we do not agree often  but we at least have a good collegial time doing it   i just want to stress the points that i made   and the fact of the matter is that having a mandate that every state put all their money toward outofschool youth does not help those states that have an inschool youth issue   it also deprives a lot of programs that are working w,0
mr chairman  i object   ,0
mr chairman  once again my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are claiming they want to help workers in this nation   but  as usual  their actions say otherwise   the newest wia proposal does nothing more than force workers to compete with each other for services that they have come to expect and services they deserve from the wia system   wia onestops provide important job training services to help those struggling to find work to get resources they need   if this bill passes  ,0

mr chairman  i thank the chairman and the gentleman from california for allowing me to participate in this debate   mr chairman  i am somewhat perplexed and disappointed by the tactics from the other side   this is serious business  and simply working to divide our citizens i believe to be counterproductive   this bill  this bill  will enhance employment  it will increase employment and job retention  plus increase the overall skill level of our labor force   now  the demagoguery t,1
mr chairman  i appreciate the opportunity to speak again on this  and i am astounded  frankly  at the level of misinformation that is coming from the other side   i think it is important to look at the bill specifically as it defines youth   the definition of youth has changed   the age for when an individual is considered a youth has changed   currently it is 14 to 21 years   in the bill  it would change it from 16 to 24 years   what that means is that we have more individuals out o,1

mr chairman  the policies congress has implemented over the last four years have provided a solid foundation for american workers and businesses to build a strong economy   with steady job growth over the last 20 months putting over 27 million americans back to work  it is clear that congress has the right priorities  working americans and their families   american workers need access to jobtraining in order that they may obtain the skills to perform the jobs of the 21st century   ameri,1
mr speaker  about 50 percent of americans or so are employed in small businesses  and obviously if something is employing almost half of americans that are working  that should be a priority   and one can imagine my surprise the other day to find out about a guy who drove up to a bank in an old ford  about a 15yearold ford pickup truck  with rust holes in the floor   he went into that bank and he took out a loan for  2 million   and the head of the bank was inquiring of the guy that ,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to s 256   this bill helps big credit card companies at the expense of working families in crisis   a harvard university study reports that more than fortyfive percent of all bankruptcies are filed because of a health emergency   approximately ninety percent of all bankruptcies are due to a health care debt  job loss  or a divorce   when this personal crisis happens  families are driven into crushing credit card debt that they ultimately can not manage,0

mr speaker  i want to rise in support of the rule that will allow us to consider the permanent repeal of the death tax   mr speaker  i think it is so appropriate  so very appropriate that this week  as millions of american taxpayers are finalizing their federal income tax filings that we are looking at what is one of the most egregious taxes and most unfair taxes to our small business community   i am one of those that fully believes that the death tax is the triple tax  because america,1

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   mr speaker  the reform of the nation s bankruptcy laws which our actions today will accomplish is well justified   this reform is strongly in the interests of consumers   it will significantly reduce the annual hidden tax of approximately  400 that the typical consumer pays because others are misusing the bankruptcy laws   that amount represents the increased cost of credit and the increased price of goods and services caused by ,1
mr speaker  i rise today to comment on the republicans  priorities   many of them talk about protecting veterans and making sure that veterans have the support they need when they return from protecting this country s freedom in iraq   today the house passed hr 8 to make permanent the repeal of the estate tax   this bill will cost the american taxpayers  295 billion over the next 10 years   the cost on the first 2 years could go as high as  1 trillion   this bill gives a tax break t,0
mr speaker  i rise today in support of the permanent repeal of the death tax   to put it simply  the death tax is just wrong   it is wrong to encourage people to work hard all their life  only to have the government reap the benefits when they die   it is wrong to levy hefty taxes against families of thriving small business owners just because their parents were successful   it is wrong to stifle economic growth by forcing small businesses to close because of an overbearing tax bill deli,1
mr speaker  we have before us today a bill that provides a safety net for people who have lost a job  had health problems  or served in the military and can not repay their debts   it gives them the opportunity for a fresh start while continuing to hold accountable those who are able to repay their debts   bankruptcy abuse represents a `` hidden tax  on the american people   when businesses have to raise the cost of their products due to unpaid liabilities  that cost is passed unfairly,1

mr speaker  i yield myself 1 minute   we should all be embarrassed that instead of repealing the biggest loophole in the bankruptcy code  we have had 8 years to study it  the homestead exemption  the bill places only weak obstacles in its path   instead of protecting women and health care providers from those who would terrorize abortion clinics  we lay out a blueprint for them to avoid their debts   instead of helping individuals who have lost their job or faced a health care emergency,0
mr speaker  i rise in support of this rule and the bill authored by the gentleman from missouri  mr hulshof   and commend him for his great work on behalf of america s job creators   i just heard the democratic member say that only a tiny fraction of the people who die in america and their families have to pay this death tax   apparently  the gentleman has never had to go through the dreaded form 706   how many of us right now are trying to deal with form 1040   even though we deal wi,1

mr speaker  to listen to this majority  we have a crisis in this country  one brought on by spendthrifts defrauding the public via our bankruptcy system   indeed  to look at the statistics  we are facing a crisis  but it has nothing to do with ordinary americans acting irresponsibly or even our bankruptcy system   last year  more than a millionandahalf families resorted to declaring bankruptcy  a full half of which occurred not because of any irresponsible behavior but because o,0

mr speaker  i rise today as a cosponsor of hr 8 and in support of this rule   i believe  as most americans do  that it is unacceptable for a grieving family who has recently lost a loved one to get a visit from the undertaker and the irs on the very same day   it is unconscionable  and it ought to be illegal   the death tax is really a tax on the american dream   americans work hard all their lives building up farms and ranches and small businesses  hoping that maybe one day they can,1

mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  i appreciate in large measure the tone of the debate   what i would say to the gentlewoman who just spoke and to others who raised the red herring of social security is to remind folks  first of all  the federal receipts from the federal death tax represent less than 15 percent of all revenues  first of all  and  secondly  that none of the income tax money generated from the estate tax goes to social security for the tr,1

mr speaker  i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from washington  miss mcmorris   a newly elected member from the state of washington   miss mcmorris   mr speaker  i appreciate the opportunity to address the house today on this very important piece of legislation  the repeal of the death tax and making it permanent   the repeal of the death tax is one of the first bills that i was honored to place my name on as a cosponsor   growing up on a family farm in eastern washington  i have ,1
mr speaker  benjamin franklin noted over 200 years ago that `` in this world nothing can be said to be certain  except death and taxes  unfortunately  the convergence of these two inescapable events  in the form of the federal estate tax  results in a number of destructive outcomes in terms of slower economic growth  reduced social mobility  and wasted productive activity   moreover  the costs imposed by the estate tax far outweigh any benefits that the tax might produce   for thes,1
mr speaker  i rise today in strong support of making estate tax relief permanent so that familyowned farms and businesses can be passed down from generation to generation   the estate tax should be updated and modernized to reflect both the economic growth many americans have experienced in recent years  and the hard work of millions of entrepreneurs and those just trying to make a living   these businesses should not be punished for being successful or for simply having their owners pass ,0
mr speaker  i rise today in support of this legislation because the current system needs reform to protect those people truly in need of debt relief  while holding accountable those who can repay their debt   bankruptcy filings have risen steadily in recent years  an indication that our current system is an ineffective one that discourages consumers from saving and planning responsibly and ultimately is nt good for consumers  families  or a society that values individual responsibility ,0
mr speaker  i am proud to vote in favor of s 256  the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005   this important bill brings needed reforms to our nation s bankruptcy system   the legislation reduces the unfair disparity of treatment in the bankruptcy system by establishing more uniform and predictable standards   i am particularly pleased to note the compromise reached on healthcare and employee benefits   this legislation takes great strides to protect patients ,1
mr speaker  almost half of the bankruptcies in the united states are connected to an illness in the family  whether people had health insurance or not   middleclass americans  who had the misfortune of either experiencing a medical emergency themselves or watching a family member suffer  were then forced to face the daunting task of pulling themselves out of debt   bankruptcy law has allowed them to start over   it has given hope   now this new law will put people on their own   illne,0
today i rise in support of the pomeroy substitute to hr 8  the estate tax repeal permanency act  and in opposition to the underlying bill   as the son of a small business owner  i know firsthand the tax burden placed on entrepreneurs and working families  and i support efforts to responsibly protect small business owners   the pomeroy substitute provides needed relief by eliminating estate taxes for assets totaling  35 million per individual or  7 million per married couple   increas,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   mr speaker  it is fascinating if you would think if there was a proposal in the substitute to eliminate the whole list of taxes that the gentleman referred to  but i have never heard one case where they have talked about eliminating any tax  only increasing taxes   so it is quite an interesting debate   let me just say  i come to this as someone who grew up in a family farm operation  a family small business   i can tell you fi,1
mr speaker  this bill hurts americans   one group who will be especially hurt are family forced into bankruptcy because of a medical crisis   a recent study conducted by professors at harvard medical and law school showed that about half of all personal bankruptcies can be attributed to medical costs   among those who cited illnesses as a cause of bankruptcy  the average unreimbursed medical costs totaled nearly  12  000 even though more than threequarters had health insurance   how do,0

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   let me just make a couple of points here   this is not about protecting small businesses or family farms   i mean  i think that is clear to everybody here   this is about protecting the threetenths of the 1 percent wealthiest people in this country   i enter into the record an article that appeared in today s washington post that really kind of explains what this debate is all about  about how mars candy  gallo wine  and campbe,0

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   again  i am having trouble following this debate here   the gentlewoman from tennessee talked about the thousands of people in her district that had to pay the estate tax last year   i am reading from a report here that said there were roughly 440 taxable estates  or about 2 percent of all taxable estates were made up of farm and business assets in the year 2004   what we are talking about here  and again  if we agree to the pomer,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i want to make it clear  as there is a lot of misinformation being promoted on the other side here  our side supports relief for family farmers and small businesses   that is not what we are talking about here today   the difference between our approach is the threetenths of 1 percent richest people in this country  the paris hiltons of the world  the executives at campbell soup  the heirs of campbell soup or mars candy if you re,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   let me again  just for the record  point out that the pomeroy substitute would provide  3 million in relief for individuals immediately   35 million by 2009  and  7 million per couple   and  again  what we are talking about here is not what the gentleman just spoke of   what we are talking about here is the richest of the rich in this country   mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0

mr speaker  i did not say the bill did not pay for service members  medical expenses who are injured in iraq or afghanistan   i said if they incur debt after they come back from serving this country and are forced to bankruptcy  they get the punitive means test   that is wrong   we should not do it to people serving in iraq and afghanistan   ,0
mr speaker  i think this piece of legislation that the majority is clearly going to be able to pass today is one of the most outrageous tax cuts that we have brought to the house floor   the democrats are going to offer an alternative  and i appreciate the fact that it was allowed by the rules committee  but this alternative would exempt 997 percent of american families from having to pay inheritance taxes   so all we are really talking about is threetenths of 1 percent  a relative hand,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from california  mr stark   for yielding me this time   mr speaker  the gentleman from florida said i want members to give me a good reason why we should not repeal the estate tax   let me give members two good reasons  afghanistan and iraq   the idea that we would be borrowing the money to pay for afghanistan and iraq when by just leaving this tax in place we could pay for those incursions and maybe get the humvees to those men and women who are defe,0
mr speaker  you would not even exempt our brothers and sisters coming back from war  and you want me to believe that this is reasonable legislation   rising debt levels in turn reflect a shift in our economy away from a time when families could afford to save and into a time when their wages are stagnant   the costs of their health premiums increased 163 percent since 1988   their tuitions have increased 170 percent   their mortgages  their child care   this is not a stable economy   t,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   i am proud to be a part of the committee on rules  which reported out a very balanced rule that allows both sides to be heard on this issue   the interesting thing about this issue is that there is agreement that the death tax should go away   there is disagreement about the numbers and the number of people for whom it should go away  our side believing that it should be totally repealed  the other side believing that there ar,1
mr speaker  the issue before us today is certainly not a new on new one   during the past three congresses  the house has voted repeatedly in a bipartisan fashion to eliminate the death tax   and today  once again  we have the opportunity to bury the death tax once and for all   the death tax punishes savings  thrift  and hard work among american families   small businesses and farmers  in particular  are unfairly penalized for their blood  sweat and tears  paying taxes on alread,1
mr speaker  today  congress has the opportunity to finish the task of preventing corporate malfeasance by agreeing to pass s 256   included in this bill is a sensible provision that sharply limits to  125  000 the homestead exemption that many ceos and corporate officers have used to shield their assets from creditors after they plunder their shareholders  wealth   by empowering the government to go after the illgotten gains that crooked corporate officers tie up in offshore mansions ,1

mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to the socalled bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of 2005   contrary to its name  this bill does not protect consumers and it certainly does not help honest  hardworking families with financial problems   the only thing that this bill does is distort our bankruptcy laws so that working families are treated more like criminals than people in need of relief   our bankruptcy laws must strike a fair and practical balance between ,0
mr speaker  this is actually one of the more absurd debates that i have ever heard in my life  and i think anybody who turns on the television and wonders what is going on here in congress will then conclude that the reason that this institution is held in so low regard is because we have debates like this   let us look at what is going on in america today   the middle class is shrinking   study after study shows that real wages for american workers are going down  and in the last 4 years,0

mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to hr 810   this bill  which we have already heard today  would reverse the embryonic stem cell policy instituted by the president of the united states in 2001  and i believe it is very misguided  in my opinion   i wish to thank the majority leader  the gentleman from texas  mr delay    and the gentleman from florida  mr weldon   for their work on this legislation against hr 810   they have already outlined many of the reasons wh,0
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  i rise today to oppose public funding for the destruction of human embryos   there is actually a very simple reason for that  and that is because you and i were once embryos   now  an embryo may seem like some scientific or laboratory term  but  in fact  the embryo contains the unique information that defines a person   all you add is food and climate control and some time  and the embryo becomes you or me   now  there are people who want to use publ,0

mr speaker  i thank the majority leader and my chairman for yielding me this time   i do rise in opposition to this bill today   the debate that we are about is expanding federal funding  not limiting research   there are no bona fide treatments available for embryonic stem cells   there is nothing in the laboratory  and there is certainly nothing in the clinics available to patients   honesty is an important part of this debate  and i am concerned that more than a promise has been off,0

mr speaker  most of my colleagues that support this bill are from the prochoice field   i come at it from the prolife section   a lot of times i disagree with my colleagues because i think in some cases they would go further  and a fact that many people will not take under their wing is that many of these stem cells are going to be thrown away  either cryogenically they deteriorate and they throw them away  or a woman says `` i do nt want to keep them for 1  000 years  and they disc,1

mr speaker  before yielding to the gentlewoman from new york  mrs lowey    i would just yield a minute to myself to respond to a couple of comments   first of all  there is a misconception here   under the castledegette bill  no public funds are used for embryo destruction   current law precludes that and we keep that under our bill   secondly  we are not spending  60 million through the nih through embryonic stem cell research   last year it was really  25 million  and the rea,1

in working with the minority leader s office and your office  there have been requests to accommodate some members and start this debate early in the afternoon instead of early in the morning   i would  along with the unanimousconsent request  anticipate us working out an agreeable time  and i would expect after discussions already being held that we would anticipate the debate to start on that bill somewhere early in the afternoon and running for the length of time agreed to by both side,0
we do have a very  very full schedule over the next few weeks   as the gentleman knows and most of the members know  the appropriations committee is trying their best to get all the appropriations bills out of the house before the july 4 break  so there is very little time between now and the fourth of july to do other bills   we are considering the head start bill  but we do not have any immediate plans to consider the head start bill reauthorization and hope that we can get to it as soon,0
as the gentleman knows  this house passed the highway bill some weeks ago and the senate just finished the highway bill in their chamber   we will probably have to consider some type of shortterm extension next week  hopefully an agreedto extension bill   and if the senate requests a conference next week  i believe that the speaker will be prepared to appoint house conferees next week   ,0
mr speaker  i would just say that the president has been criticized for not vetoing any bills over the last 4 12 years  but it has become a tradition around here to include the president as we do legislation through the house and the senate and therefore working out any of our differences so that he would not have to veto a bill  and i do not see that the highway bill is any different than anything else we have been doing for the last 4 12 years   so he is obviously a major player in this,0
mr speaker  i appreciate the gentleman s yielding to me   i would just point out to the gentleman that in the good old days that he refers to  yes  this house had a great reputation for wanting to spend more money  and those days have changed in that the president is adamant about spending and spending the right amount of money to do the job and the house has concurred in that many times and have voted in the house   and it has been a pleasure to work with the president to hold down spen,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time   mr speaker  i rise in support of this bill  which will expand funding for embryonic stem cell research  and i am proud to be an original cosponsor of it   what i would like to say today is the following  scientists have informed us  the professional scientists in our country  not political scientists  but scientists  and what they have told us from their considerable work and research is that this issue represents hope   it,1
mr speaker  today the house is considering hr 810  the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005  which expands funding for embryonic stem cell research   as an advocate of stem cell research  i m proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation because i believe that this critical research can lead to cures for type 1 diabetes  parkinson s disease  alzheimer s disease  paralysis caused by spinal cord injury  and other serious health problems   over 3  000 people die every,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of hr 810  the stem cell research enhancement act   scientific and biomedical research and innovation has made our nation and our world a safer and healthier place   advances in medicine have made virtually obsolete killer diseases like smallpox and polio  have increased life expectancy and improved the quality of life for people around the globe   from roman times around 2000 years ago to 1900 life expectancy increased from 25 to 47 years of age   however,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of hr 810 because we need to support studying every kind of stem cell  from cord blood to adult to embryonic   parkinson s disease affects over 1 million americans  and i am one of them   many people think that this is a disease that mostly affects older citizens   that is not true   i was diagnosed when i was in my mid40s and michael j fox  for example  was much younger than that   parkinson s does not keep me from doing the things that are importa,1
mr speaker  i thank the chairman for yielding me time   mr speaker  today we will hear some of our colleagues talk about the empty promise of embryonic stem cell research   they will argue for research that not only requires the destruction of human life  but to date  has also not yielded a single therapy   what we in congress should be advocating for is the continuing advancement of adult stem cell research  a true scientific success story  which has benefited thousands of americans ,0
mr speaker  i thank both gentlemen for yielding me this time   the debate over embryonic stem cell research is important because there are no more important issues that we deal with in this chamber than when we debate life and death   mr speaker  as i stand here in this chamber today  i am a human being   i am a man  an adult man   sometime before i was a man  i was a teenager   before that i was a child   and sometime before i was a child  i was a toddler   and before i was a tod,0
mr speaker  the seminal question that we address is  should americans be using their tax dollars to fund research that kills a living human embryo   my answer to that is an emphatic `` no  it is our duty to ensure that we spend our money on things that work  and there are no therapies in humans that have ever successfully been carried out using embryonic stem cells   and that is really what this whole debate is about  paying for what works and paying for it in a way that is consistent ,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from maryland for yielding to me   and i think particularly at this point i wanted to interject some thoughts   first of all  the gentleman from maryland  mr bartlett    as he pointed out just a second ago  is a phd   physiologist who taught years ago in medical school and taught physiology but  more importantly  has also taught the subject matter  which is difficult to understand   i know   i was there in medical school   and that is the subje,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding  and i thank my friend  the gentleman from nebraska  mr osborne    for being here with us tonight and for his very  very pertinent remarks in regard to where do you draw the line as far as life   i have heard people on the other side of this argument say  well  we are talking about getting these stem cells  and they are not really embryos  they are preembryos   maybe our phd   physiologist knows about the definition of preembryo ,0
mr speaker  i rise today in strong support of the gentleman from new jersey  mr smith s  stem cell therapeutics and research act of 2005  and commend the gentleman for his courageous and principled stand for the sanctity of life   as a physician member  i know that significant successes are being reported from the use of umbilical cord stem cells in the treatment of 67 diseases  including sickle cell anemia  leukemia  osteoporosis and lymphoma   there is great promise in this resear,0
mr speaker  i thank the majority leader for yielding   mr speaker  i rise this evening in opposition  strong opposition  to hr 810  not as a physician  not as an obstetriciangynecologist  but as a prolife catholic who firmly believes in the sanctity of life   i have sat here for almost 3 hours listening to every word of the debate as part of my job as a member of the rebuttal team  and here is my legal pad of notes and rebuts   most of those rebuts are against people on my side ,0
i certainly thank the gentleman from maryland for yielding   it is indeed a pleasure to again be with him tonight  madam speaker   any opportunity that i have as an original cosponsor of the gentleman from maryland s legislation  hr 3144  is an opportunity that i gladly accept no matter what the hour   the importance of this issue really can not be overstated   i know the gentleman from maryland as he started this special order hour discussed the fact that of the socalled throwaway em,0
madam speaker  i wanted to mention to the gentleman that as an obgyn physician  of course i have had some experience with some of the processes that can occur in reproductive endocrine laboratories and the technique dealing with infertile couples  and i have had a discussion with the gentleman from maryland about this   but in a situation where the couple is infertile and it is because of male infertility  there is nothing wrong with the egg  but there is a very  very low sperm count in ,0
mr speaker  i rise today to support not only hr 2520  but also hr 810  the castledegette legislation to expand federal research for embryonic stem cells   undoubtedly  each of us on this floor today has a friend  family member or neighbor who could benefit from increased embryonic stem cell research  whether they suffer from spinal cord injury  alzheimer s  ms or juvenile diabetes   as we consider both the castledegette stem cell bill and the smith legislation on umbilical cord,1
mr speaker  the promise for curing a whole host of debilitating diseases is brighter than it s ever been   today  congress has the opportunity to capitalize on breakthrough scientific research to help millions across our country   representatives castle and degette have crafted this bill meticulously  which would allow the use of surplus embryos from in vitro fertilization treatments and require donor consent   it does not allow stem cells to be sold for profit   this legislation takes ,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of the legislation to help us have continued success in the funding for research for uses for adult stem cells   adult stem cells really encompass a number of different kinds   people have talked today about cord blood   they have talked about the bone marrow stem cells   a number of them have already been used clinically and with much success   i believe it is this congress s duty to help support that  because certainly we will have many people who have be,0
mr speaker  i thank the majority leader for yielding me this time  and i am rising in opposition to the legislation that would fund the destruction of embryos in order to take the stem cells for research   there are a number of reasons that i oppose the bill   the very first one  though  is one of the statements we keep hearing over and over again from those who support the bill  and that is that these embryos would just be discarded   this morning  i met several families  parents wit,0
mr speaker  we will be hearing a great deal today about the humane and helpful and hopeful research of embryonic stem cells   this is an advance similar to advances in past years of blood transfusions and organ transplants   and to be fair  some patients do not want to take part in blood transfusions and organ transplants for personal reasons   however  for most americans  embryonic stem cell research falls well within public ethical standards   it is something that we should be support,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time   mr speaker  i am proud to represent new jersey  one of the few states that devotes its own resources to embryonic stem cell research   to help us understand this humane line of research  let us look at in vitro fertilization   several decades ago  many people raised concerns about this procedure  everywhere there were attacks using the term `` test tube babies  but today there are 400  000 young people who are the products,1
mr speaker  i rise today in strong support of the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act  hr 810  legislation that will dramatically expand the number of stem cell lines available for federally funded research   this bill will allow scientists to more effectively pursue cures and therapies for a wide array of lifethreatening illnesses and disabilities affecting millions of americans   earlier today  the house passed a related but very different bill  the stem cell therapeutic a,1

i thank the gentleman for that response   with respect to the defense authorization bill  can you tell us now what kind of a rule might be applicable to the consideration of that bill   ,1
i thank the leader   i know that our leader and your office are working on that unanimous consent and the parameters of the consideration of  as you point out  a very  very important bill   there are obviously different points of view on the legislation   i know we are going to be meeting monday night and going to come in early tuesday   would you have a thought as to when  because of the importance of this bill  our members want to be sure that they are here  as i am sure yours do as ,1
i thank the leader for that information and appreciate his working with leader pelosi in determining that  because this is important   i think all members will want to make sure that that time frame in which it will be considered  they will be available to be on the floor or be watching the floor debate with the ability to come to the floor to offer their thoughts   i thank the gentleman for that information   ,1
i thank the leader for that observation   the happy circumstance is we both certainly agree on this procedure  that it needs to have a thorough airing and debate and discussion   there are strong views on either side of this issue and quite obviously the consequences of this bill are very substantial   whether it passes or whether it fails  the consequences are substantial   so we appreciate the fact that there will be significant time to discuss and debate this issue   mr leader  i hav,1
i thank the gentleman and would hope that we could try to move that as quickly as possible   obviously  people will want to be planning for the next school year and next head start year   lastly  mr leader  the highway bill   as we know  the highway bill is now more than 2 years overdue in terms of reauthorization  has been sitting for some period of time   the senate has now passed that bill   can you tell us when we might appoint conferees for the highway conference   ,1
i thank the leader for that observation and hopefully we can  in fact  move on that   we not only passed it last week but we passed it a number of times before that   mr leader  i would simply observe on our side and  frankly  on your side that the senate number is a number that i think our committee certainly and this house could well approve   i know the president does not like that number  but very frankly  as the gentleman knows  our own committee almost unanimously on voice vote,1
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  i recall that democrats  when they were in charge  had a slightly different perspective  believing we were a coequal branch of the government   we would adopt our policies based upon what we believed to be in the best interests of this country  and that the president  as a coequal branch of the government  would make his determination  and if we disagreed we would override his veto   as a matter of fact  i voted to override a number of vetoes that t,1
mr speaker  reclaiming my time  does the gentleman by any chance remember the ag bill   ,1
the ag bill that was passed some years ago   the president was not too excited about that spending level  as i recall   he signed the bill  nevertheless   ,1
mr speaker  i have been here for some period of time  as the leader knows  and the only bill that ronald reagan vetoed that was overridden by the congress was a bill in which he said we did not spend enough money in 1983   he vetoed it because we did not spend enough money   ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentlewoman for yielding and want to congratulate the gentleman from delaware  mr castle   and the gentlewoman from colorado  ms degette   for her leadership and his leadership on this bill   this is  i think  one of the most important bills that we will consider for the welfare of people not only in this country  but throughout the world   mr speaker  let us be very clear about what this bipartisan  moderate bill would do and not do   this legislation  ,1
mr speaker  the reason this vote is so important is simply because the embryo is human life   it is not animal  it is not vegetable  it is not mineral  but a tiny  microscopic beginning of a human life   everyone in this room was an embryo at one time   i  myself  am a 192monthold embryo   the question we face is how much respect is due to this tiny little microscopic human life   if we are truly prolife  we should protect it rather than treat it as a thing to be experimented wi,0
mr speaker  i come to speak for life  life for people with diabetes  life for people with parkinson s  life for people with damaged hearts   what possible benefit is it for life to discard these cells without allowing them to be used to bring life  to save life  to preserve life   if these cells have any future  it is through curing disease   if members wish to give them life  then let them give life to others   this is their only hope  and it is our best hope   dr   connie davi,1

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   i rise in strong support of the legislation before us which i consider to be extremely important   it builds on the president s policy by merely allowing the use of embryonic stem cells created for fertility purposes to be donated with permission  but without payment  by the woman for research  research to cure some of the terrible diseases that plague our lives   these free citizens would simply exercise their right and thei,1

mr speaker  i rise in strong support of this legislation   and just to be clear once again during this debate  this bill limits the use of only those embryos that will be discarded or destroyed from in vitro fertilization clinics with the consent of the donors   i rise in support of this legislation not because it promises cures for diabetes  parkinson s  spinal cord injuries  alzheimer s  but because it gives us yet another opportunity to discover cures for these ailments   adult st,1
mr speaker  i rise today in strong support of hr 810  the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005   this bill would expand the current federal policy on embryonic stem cell research by allowing federally funded research on stem cell lines derived after august 9  2001  while implementing strong ethical guidelines to ensure federal oversight of the research   most of the scientific community believes that for the full potential of embryonic stem cell research to be reached  the number,1
mr speaker  i thank the leader for yielding me this time   i ask myself this question  if we are going to deal with this debate on embryonic stem cell research  what are the ethics of this   one can go to google and do a google search on permissible medical experiments   and i did that  and i found that there is a list of 10 things that have to be qualifiers for permissible medical experiments on human beings   one is the subject must be a volunteer   the second one is there must be no,0
mr speaker  today the political center will hold with nancy reagan  and this congress will stand for yankee ingenuity and stem cell research   our constitution stands at its heart for the principle of the dignity of every individual and this idea is certainly central to our government and people   but there is a key american principle at the heart of our people that predates the constitution   nearly all of us are the sons and daughters of people who took risks to come to build a new life ,1
mr speaker  i do rise today in strong support of hr 810   over the past two decades  threequarters of the scientists who have won the nobel prize in medicine have studied or taught in the united states   and this is not a coincidence   our nation has created an environment that values innovation and discovery  especially in biological sciences   hr 810 will help america continue to lead in this crucial field   of course  there is more at stake in this debate than america s global,1
mr speaker  i support hr 810  the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005   hr 810 is the safest  most ethically and morally sound way to proceed with this potentially lifesaving scientific advancement   this debate is not about whether or not embryonic stem cell research should occur   the administration is not stopping private embryonic stem cell research   it just opposes the expansion of public stem cell research   the private sector is not restricted from such research   t,1
mr speaker  i rise in strong support of hr 810  and i want to acknowledge the bipartisan effort that has gone into this legislation and the incredible grass roots movement that has built support for this groundbreaking medical research   it has been inspirational to see so many members putting aside politics and partisanship to address this issue which affects the lives of millions of americans   mr speaker  i am one of those americans   at age 16  i was an explorer scout in my hometo,1
mr speaker  i rise today in support of hr 810  the stem cell research enhancement act and hr 2520  the stem cell therapeutic and research act that we debated earlier today   both bills would expand stem cell research  which holds tremendous promise to curing and treating some of the most devastating diseases and conditions facing americans today   this issue is about medical research coupled with high ethical standards and providing hope to those most in need  it should have no role,1
mr speaker  we do not know yet  but the possibility is very real that stem cell research may be the greatest breakthrough in the history of science   there are deep and profound moral and philosophic issues surrounding the research  but our government should be very cautious about coming down on the wrong side of science  especially when the scientific endeavor is designed to lengthen and ennoble life   it has been suggested here today that no breakthrough therapies have yet been develope,1

mr speaker  the issue of government funding of embryonic stem cell research is one of the most divisive issues facing the country   while i sympathize with those who see embryonic stem cell research as providing a path to a cure for the dreadful diseases that have stricken so many americans  i strongly object to forcing those americans who believe embryonic stem cell research is immoral to subsidize such research with their tax dollars   the main question that should concern congress today ,0

mr speaker  i rise today in strong support of hr 810  the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005   stem cells have tremendous promise to treat a myriad of devastating diseases and disorders   embryonic stem cells can become any cell type in the body  and their promise lies in the ability to tailormake cellular treatments  heart muscle for heart disease  pancreas cells for diabetes  or nervous system cells for spinal cord injury   stem cells are relatively new on the research sce,1
mr speaker  i stand today in strong support of the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act of 2005   one of the few places this is really an extremely controversial bill is right here because the majority of americans strongly support embryonic stem cell research   they want the federal government to fund research that is critical for some 128 million americans who suffer from juvenile diabetes  parkinson s  alzheimer s  cancer  heart disease  spinal cord injuries  als  and ot,1
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  the gentleman from delaware  mr castle   and the gentlewoman from colorado  ms degette   deserve our thanks for sponsoring the stem cell research enhancement act and working with so many families who have been impacted by diseases that may find cures as a result of this vital research   their work and dedication on this legislation has been tremendous and praiseworthy   i also thank them for giving me the opportunity to cas,1
mr speaker  i thank my good friend for yielding and for his leadership on this bill and for cosponsoring it  along with the gentleman from alabama  mr davis   on the other side of the aisle for his leadership over the last 3 years as we crafted this legislation   it is finally on the floor after almost 3 years of work  and again i thank my friend  the gentleman from alabama  mr davis   for his leadership   one of the best kept secrets in america today is that umbilical cordblood st,0
mr speaker  i just want to make the point that some misinformation perhaps inadvertently is being spread on this floor  that these stem cells that are derived from cord blood only have a blood application   that is unmitigated nonsense   it is not true   and i pointed out in my opening comments that in the celgene cellular therapeutics first reported back in 2001 that placental stem cells turned into nerve  blood  cartilage  skin and muscle cells  and that since that time other studies,0
mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
mr speaker  make no mistake about it  i support aggressive stem cell research and the judicious application of stem cells to mitigate and to cure disease   that is why i sponsored the stem cell therapeutic research act of 2005 and i have been pushing it for almost 3 years   that is why those of us who oppose hr 810 strongly support pouring millions of dollars into federal funds to support ethical stem cell research to find cures  to alleviate suffering  to inspire wellfounded hope and ,0
mr speaker  this is a grand and glorious debate we are having today   think of what we are doing   we are debating the best route for achieving wonderful  healing medical possibility  possibility that would have been unheard of not many years ago   but it is only possibility   by definition  good research is always about possibility  about the potential of finding the answers to that which we do not know   let me share three perspectives with you today   first  that of a friend   t,1

mr speaker  i rise in strong support of hr 810   our research policies should be decided by scientists and doctors at the national institutes of health and not by karl rove and selfappointed religious gurus   if you believe it is morally superior to discard a single cell in a freezer rather than to use it to help millions of americans with parkinson s  alzheimer s  and diabetes  and you are asked to donate an embryo  then by all means refuse to do so   but do not tell my constituen,1
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  this debate we are having surrounding hr 810  the stem cell research enhancement act  is really one of the most fundamentally important debates that this body can undertake   regrettably  this discussion will only last a few hours on the floor of the house of representatives today   there have been no hearings on this bill or on the previous stem cell bill   hr 810 addresses the most fundamental  basic  ethical ,0

mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  as this debate has gone on  and it has been a good discussion here today  i think it is worthwhile to come back to where we are on this whole issue here   the embryonic stem cell research we are debating here today is controversial because of the means of obtaining these cells   research involving most types of stem cells  those derived from adult tissues or the umbilical cord  is uncontroversial except  as we saw  ,0
mr speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0
mr speaker  i have one more speaker and then i plan on closing   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   mr speaker  there has been a lot of discussion today about the quality of adult stem cells and they are not as versatile as embryonic stem cells   there are a number of things that show adult stem cells are highly versatile and just as effective if not more effective than the predicted embryonic stems   the list of these studies is as follows  myth  adult stem cells are not as versatile as embryonic stem cells   fact  a number of stu,0
mr speaker  it is important that i give voice to the important issue of stem cell research   this is not an issue that anyone takes lightly   life is precious in all forms  and it is important to do all that we can to ensure issues surrounding life and quality of life are given the highest priority   millions of americans suffer from debilitating diseases like juvenile diabetes  parkinson s disease  alzheimer s and a host of other diseases that reduce the quality of life or cause loss ,1
mr speaker  58 to zero   today we are asked to sear our conscience and harden our heart towards human life so we can experiment on fertilized human embryos because we are told it holds such great promise   the results from testing are far from promising  though   they are very disappointing   but there is an alternative   the adult stem cell research has been very successful compared to embryonic stem cell research  and this success was accomplished without the destruction of human life,0
mr speaker  i rise today as a cosponsor and strong supporter of hr 810  the stem cell research enhancement act   i am pleased that the house leadership brought this important legislation to the floor and am proud to be a part of the important debate occurring today   mr speaker  embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body  and many believe they may have the potential to treat many illnesses such as parkinson s disease  juvenile diabetes  alzh,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of this bipartisan bill  and i will submit today s column in the wall street journal written by dr   david a shaywitz  an endocrinologist in stem cell research at harvard  for the record   i would call to the attention of my colleagues this column and particularly a couple of lines that he wrote today   i must say that i am one that will be voting for both bills today  the cord bill as well as the castledegette bill  but as you compare these two bills ,1
mr speaker  as a cosponsor of the stem cell research enhancement act of 2005  i believe that stem cell research holds the promise of scientific breakthroughs that could improve the lives of millions of americans   this bipartisan legislation would provide federal funding for a wider range of research while establishing ethical guidelines   the most compelling arguments for expanding federal funding for stem cell research can be heard in the heart wrenching stories of individuals suffering ,1
mr speaker  the gentleman that just preceded me  speaking to the house  said that he did not think this experimentation would work   well  there is no way it will ever work if we do not allow the research to take place   there can be nothing that is more prolife than trying to pursue research that scientists tell us will lead to cures for ms and diabetes and parkinson s and other terrible diseases that people now suffer and die from   some people have said  well  let us have an alter,1
mr speaker  i commend the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce and his staff  as well as the gentleman from new jersey  mr smith    for their diligent work on bringing this very  very good bill to the floor of the house   what we are going to be voting for here will help create a banking system so that if a patient comes in to see me with a particular illness that is amenable to treatment with stem cells  i can enter their genetic information in a computer  find a match of,0
mr speaker  i rise again to set the record straight   there have been some people who have implied there is limited capacity for these cord blood stems to be used successfully   they have been shown to be pluripotent   they can become all different cell types  and they have shown a tremendous amount of plasticity   this poster is of a young lady who was paralyzed for years and had an adult stem cell transplant   she is able to stand up   but i just want to clarify on the cord blood  it,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding time to me  and i commend the gentleman for his leadership on this issue   we have heard a lot of discussion of the three known forms of stem cell therapies that are hypothesized to treat all these diseases   one of the nice things about adult stem cell treatments and why i think they have been embraced  and part of the reason they have been so successful is  if you use a cell from your own body  there are no tissue rejection concerns   if ,0

mr speaker  i oppose this bill and support the president s position on embryonic stem cells   let s be clear   embryonic stem cell research is legal in america today  and nothing in the administration s current policy has affected the legality of this research   the administration s policy simply provides that federal taxpayer dollars not be used to destroy human embryos   i believe most americans  when they understand this  agree with the administration   but this rule does not in,0
mr speaker  i rise today in support of this bill and all of the promise that comes with funding embryonic stem cell research   this bill represents an important step forward for the scientific and medical communities in our country  offering hope to the millions of americans who suffer from diseases that stem cell therapies may be able to cure   unfortunately  president bush has threatened to veto this bill when it arrives on his desk   i am appalled that a president who talks so much abo,1

mr speaker  i rise in strong support of hr 2520  which combines legislation i introduced and passed in the 108th congress to reauthorize the national bone marrow registry with legislation by my colleague from new jersey  mr smith  to authorize a federal investment in building an inventory of 150  000 umbilical cord blood units   this lifesaving bill is good for patients  good for transplant doctors  good for researchers and it represents good policy for our nation   i would like to ,1
mr speaker  i rise today in opposition to hr 810  but in strong support of adult stem cell research as it respects life   an embryo is a human at its earliest stage of life and deserves the same respect that we give infants  adolescents and adults   during this debate  some would attempt to justify embryonic stem cell research on the basis that we are dealing with something other than real human beings   we use the words stem cell  but we could also use the words nathan and noah   th,0
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   i rise in support of hr 2520  which i really view as a noncontroversial  bipartisan piece of legislation that we should all be able to agree on   i think one speaker a moment ago talked about science and our obligation to promote science   i would agree with him  but with this caveat  science tells us what we can do  science does not tell us what we should do   that is an ethical dimension  and we are called upon oftenti,0
mr speaker  just in response to what was said on the floor  this is a statement that has appeared on the floor  and also in print  which says that the bill before us prohibits federal funding used for the destruction of embryos   by its very definition  it requires the destruction of embryos when it does the research   that ought to be very clear   the process talked about requires the destruction of embryos   ,0

mr speaker  as a physician  i know that respected scientists believe that misrepresentations and exaggerated claims in this debate are not only scientifically irresponsible  they are deceptive and cruel to millions of patients and their families who hope desperately for cures   it seems to me that there is one unmistakable fact   many in our society have sincere  heartfelt  passionate  ethical questions  worthy of our respect  regarding the scientific or medical use of embryonic stem ,0
mr speaker  as a physician i m certain of one thing  science is not republican or democrat  science is not conservative or liberal   science is science   decisions in science should be based on the scientific method  a standardized method of evaluation and implementation of a solution or treatment of a disease   when followed  it allows for the greatest amount of critical thinking about any issue   if followed  it results in the best outcome   this would be true in public policy as,0
mr speaker  i thank the majority leader for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise to vigorously oppose hr 810   it is ethically wrong to destroy human life  and hr 810 would allow for federal funding to destroy human embryos   as a heart surgeon  i have dealt with life and death   i have held damaged hearts in these hands  and i have seen how powerful human emotions  coupled with hope  can be  but human emotions coupled with false hope and misinformation are dangerous   e,0

mr speaker  i rise in strong support of hr 810  to provide for human embryonic stem cell research   the measure is a crucial first step toward helping millions of people who suffer today from diseases that are currently without treatment   by broadening the federal government s investment in this nascent technology  i am confident that we will be able to offer help to these men  women  and children that would be impossible by conventional means   the room for growth in embryonic stem,1
mr speaker  as stewards of hardworking americans  tax dollars  we can not ask our constituents to fund the killing of human embryos   like the rest of my colleagues joining me today  i am strongly in support of scientific research to save and improve human life   but to fund federal research on stem cells derived from killing human embryos is unethical and irresponsible   while stem cell research has never been prohibited in the private sector  president bush permitted the usage of emb,0
mr speaker  i thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding me this time   we are here debating hr 810  which directs the federal government to spend tax dollars on embryonic stem cell research   this bill  therefore  implies that stem cell research is not already going on  but stem cell research is alive and well in america   adult stem cells are currently being used to treat people  and successfully   this bill s approach  however  will remove stem cells from human embry,0

mr speaker  i make a point of order against the motion   ,1
mr speaker  the points of order that the gentleman from wisconsin has been raising have been pursuant to house rules  and we should not be waiving the rules relative to the germaneness of motions to recommit   should the gentleman from mississippi offer more nongermane motions to recommit  then i think it is incumbent upon me  as the manager of the bill  to raise a point of order  should the rules of the house be violated by the motion to recommit  as they have been in the past   ,1

in its present form   ,1
mr speaker  given the nature of this motion  i ask unanimous consent that the clerk read it again   ,1
mr speaker  i ask unanimous consent  given the gravity of this motion  that the clerk read the motion again since  apparently  no one on this floor  other than i  know what is in it   ,1
mr speaker  what we are talking about today is a fairly simple thing   the text of the original bill is to give the 50 states the legal authority to  on a statebystate basis  prevent the desecration of the flag  a symbol of our country   there is something a heck of a lot more serious going on than the desecration of the flag  it is the desecration of our nation   in the last 4 years alone  the national debt has increased by  21 trillion   we have taken money out of the social sec,1
mr speaker  the point of order is  why would we take the time to protect the symbol of our country if we will not take the time to protect the financial future of our country as well   that is my point   ,1
mr speaker  what is the procedure to appeal the ruling of the chair   i would like the ability to speak to that  please   ,1
mr speaker  i am appealing the ruling of the chair  and i would like to speak to that point   ,1
mr speaker  is that debatable   ,1
mr speaker  it is my understanding under the rule passed by the committee on rules that the minority is guaranteed a motion to recommit   ,1
mr speaker  i demand a recorded vote   ,1
mr speaker  i have a parliamentary inquiry   ,1
mr speaker  having read the rule  it said that the minority was to be given a motion to recommit   if that motion to recommit was ruled out of order  does the minority still have the right to offer another motion to recommit   ,1
mr speaker  i offer a motion to recommit   ,1
mr speaker  i am opposed to the bill in its present form   ,1
the point of order is to my colleagues  if you think it is wrong to desecrate the flag  i would hope that you would think it is wrong to misspend money taken out of people s wallets that we promised to spend on their social security and to protect that money in the constitution   ,1
mr speaker  i appeal the ruling of the chair   ,1

mr speaker  when i looked at today s floor schedule  i was pleasantly surprised to see an item addressing the issue of declining united states competitiveness in the world   the fact is the issue of competitiveness has not been a priority for republican leaders in this congress or in any preceding one in the last 10 years  and i thought perhaps finally the republicans had woken up   unfortunately  i was very disappointed when i read the text of the proposal because this plan is nonbindin,0
mr speaker  i voted for h res 352 because i agree that there are barriers to keeping and creating jobs within the united states and that federal agencies ought to review their rules and policies to improve the competitiveness of our economy   but i do not associate myself with the sense of the `` whereas  clauses that america must adopt foreign values and standards in order to compete economically   i also note that the `` whereas  clauses include partisan distortions and falsehoods th,1

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman very much for yielding me this time   and i must say that never have i seen a resolution that demonstrates so completely the lack of understanding by the other side of what is necessary to maintain and improve america s competitiveness in the world economy   they go through all of their whereases  but when they get to the therefores  this resolution does nothing  does nothing   they ignore what those people who are on the cutting edge of trying to impro,0
mr speaker  i yield myself 5 minutes   mr speaker  none of us could be against removing barriers   however  the definition of barriers allows room for a lot of disagreement   it is very interesting that the thrust of this resolution is that regulations in the united states are barriers to competitiveness  and yet our economy is linked to a nation which has the maximum number of barriers in terms of regulatory procedures  the economy of china   china is still a communist government   ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   i certainly look forward to working with the gentleman also   mr speaker  in closing  i would like to just cite a few examples of how republican policies have shortchanged the initiatives which they talked about today   instead of having an aggressive policy on math and science education  the bush administration has underinvested in proven math and science instruction   today  china graduates four times as many engineers as the u,0
mr speaker  on that i demand the yeas and nays   ,0
mr speaker  there is really nothing terribly  terribly wrong with this resolution   talking about a need to invest in greater innovation  research and education  certainly makes sense   the vexing thing for me is this republican congress and white house has systematically unfunded almost all of those items   we heard the numbers from my colleagues  and i will not go back over them  except to remind folks of the recent debate we had over the appropriations bills   repeatedly  througho,0

mr speaker  i thank the gentleman from louisiana for yielding me this time   the gentleman from washington  mr smith   did talk about some issues that i think are very important  especially when he talked about education   i think education is very important for the future of this economy   if we look at education spending over the last 5 years  we have had dramatic increases in education  as far as the spending is concerned   what we need to do now is focus on math  science  engin,1

mr speaker  i am not voting for this resolution  because i think it does not make a constructive contribution to the problems facing our country and the national economy   the resolution says that trade restrictions and inequality are barriers to keeping and creating jobs in the united states  but it does nothing about them  just as it does nothing to make it easier for americans looking for work to find good jobs   the resolution says that bureaucratic red tape is a barrier to economic ,0

mr chairman  i rise today to oppose hr 3199   as the gentleman just mentioned  i was a member of the committee on the judiciary on september 11  2001   and in the weeks that followed  i joined my colleagues in committee to carefully craft a bill to give law enforcement personnel additional and powerful tools to fight terror   but as many of you recall  the work product of our committee was rejected at the eleventh hour in favor of a far more expansive act which has continued to raise ,0
i think underlying the gentleman from michigan s question  is this not about the difference between the fbi and law enforcement using a national security letter to ask a bank to give it the financial records of all of its customers versus asking the bank to give it the financial records of the specific individuals it suspects might be involved or that it is interested in   i think that is at the heart of the question of the standard   that is why relevance to a terrorist investigation is not,0

mr chairman  the patriot act was enacted in the wake of the 911 terrorist attacks  rushed through the house as a suspension bill the day after it was introduced   this process did nt permit the public  let alone congress  to fully understand it   the original bill was rewritten in the rules committee instead of the bipartisan bill that was unanimously passed out of the judiciary committee   luckily  there were a few sunset provisions that were intended to help keep people honest and e,0

mr speaker  i rise this evening to ask that the house retain its oversight authority by inserting 4year sunsets into hr 3199   in the past year  we have asked the department of justice how it is using the authority granted to it under the patriot act   some of our questions simply went unanswered   other questions were rebuffed  and we were told that the information was classified   and still others were avoided by telling us that the information simply was not available   however  ,0

madam speaker  i yield myself 30 seconds   for basis of clarification  the motion to instruct that we have put forward applies to lone wolf  as the gentleman from wisconsin indicates   but it also applies to sections 206 and 215   the house sunsets those in 10 years  and we would instruct conferees to adopt the senate 4year sunset   i wanted to be sure that was well understood   madam speaker  i reserve the balance of my time   ,0

mr chairman  i appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time   over the past 3 years  the patriot act has played a key role in the prevention of terrorist attacks right here in the united states   prior to the patriot act  the ability of government agencies to share information with each other was limited  which kept investigators from fully understanding what terrorists might be planning and to prevent their attacks   the us attorney for the northern district of indiana  joseph van ,1

mr chairman  i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for yielding me this time   mr chairman  i will reiterate what has been previously said this date about the patriot act  and i do so for emphasis   the first point i want to emphasize is the assurance that the house committee on the judiciary and the crime  terrorism  and homeland security subcommittee did not give the patriot act a mere wink and a nod   we  in fact  hosted 12 public hearings  three before the full committee  nine b,1

ladies and gentlemen of the house  let me say from the outset that every member of this body wants to make sure that law enforcement officials have the tools they need to protect the american people from terrorism   i also know that all of us want to make sure that we protect our civil liberties and freedoms as we fight terrorists anywhere in the world and in this country as well   i support the majority of the 166 provisions of the patriot act   in fact  in the first original patriot act ,0

reclaiming my time  i am sorry i was not on the committee the day they had the hearing  but normally death penalty matters are not brought to the floor this way   normally i thought it was the jurisdiction of the subcommittee on criminal justice in the committee on the judiciary of the house that would be considering this matter   ,0

madam speaker  i yield myself 35 seconds   i want to give chairman sensenbrenner the benefit of the presumption of a doubt about this section 215 business   what happens in the report is it makes it easier to get library and other records under section 215 by creating a presumption that records of anyone to come into contact with a suspected terrorist even accidentally  innocently  is relevant to an investigation   madam speaker  what he has done is he has moved a part of section 215 to a,0

madam speaker  there is no question that congress must give law enforcement the tools it needs to prevent terrorist attacks against the american people   when the congress approved the patriot act 4 years ago  we recognized that the serious nature of the threat required giving law enforcement broad new powers to help prevent it   there is also no question that the house and senate should not allow the patriot act to expire on december 31   indeed  nearly all of the 166 provisions of the pa,0
mr chairman  after 911  i worked on the drafting of the patriot act in the committee and in the weekend drafting session  and i voted for the act on the floor   i think it is important to know that most of what is in the patriot act is not actually before us today   it is only the 16 provisions that are socalled sunsetted  which means that we need to review them and renew them  that are actually before the house today   first and foremost  as the justice department said in their lett,0
mr chairman  i would just note that we have spent since 911 only a couple hundred million dollars in homeland security to secure our rail systems   that is the real problem here   we spent nearly  25 billion on air security and a couple of hundred million on rail   i would also not that although i do not oppose the death penalty  i doubt very much the death penalty is going to deter the suicide bombers   i think we need to look at not deterrents but at actually preventing the terrorists,0
mr chairman  here is my question   section 208 of the social security act apparently states it is illegal to use a false social security number for activities to obtain employment   if i am a 14yearold kid and i go out and make up a social security number so i can get a job and pretend i am 18  and i get money for it  have i violated section 208   and if so  if i deal with a bank  is the bank falling afoul of this terrorism statute   ,0
mr speaker  i would just note the most important thing in the patriot act is the sharing of information between law enforcement and intelligence   i support that reauthorization   i am a member of the judiciary committee  a member of the homeland security committee   the department of justice has stonewalled congress on telling us how they are using these powers   i am a member of the conference committee   republicans met secretly and separately away from democrats on the conference com,0
madam speaker  i thank the gentleman from the great city of worcester  massachusetts  for yielding   madam speaker  i rise in opposition to the conference report on hr 3199  the socalled usa patriot act  because we have not taken meaningful steps to eliminate or correct the most egregious sections of this act   in particular  it is disappointing that the conference agreement does not include a meaningful judicial review mechanism for fisa wiretaps  under the foreign intelligence sur,0
madam speaker  i rise in strong opposition to the conference report on the usa patriot reauthorization act   as a member of the homeland security committee since its creation almost 3 years ago  i understand the importance of providing our nation s counterterror and law enforcement officers with the capabilities to act aggressively to detect and deter terrorist attacks   as cochairman of the congressional privacy caucus  i remain concerned about government encroachments into the private ,0
i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time   mr speaker  i rise today in opposition to this restrictive rule  and i rise in opposition to the underlying bill   protecting our homeland from another terrorist attack is among the most important priorities we face   we must support our law enforcement officials by providing them with the proper resources and modern technologies to combat terrorism   there is a delicate balance that must be maintained between security and liberty   i b,0
mr speaker  i rise today in strong opposition to hr 3199   while this conference report makes some improvement to the current patriot act  it fails to address some major deficiencies  and in many ways  it makes the current situation worse   the original intent of the patriot act was to provide our law enforcement officials with the necessary tools to make our country more secure   while maintaining national security is absolutely a necessary responsibility of congress  it can and must,0

madam speaker  i will close for our side   madam speaker  this bill overreaches   it paves the way for abuse and is a potential threat to innocent  lawabiding citizens   we are not a police state  and what makes us different from so many others is our freedom and our respect for basic civil liberties and our respect for privacy   i understand the urge of some to embrace this legislation  but let me remind you that every time you chip away at our civil liberties  you give the terrorist,0

mr chairman  the devastation of 911 shook our collective consciousness to the core  but it should not have shattered the foundation that defines who we are as a people and serves as a beacon of individual rights and liberties throughout the world   our nation has been able to overcome the challenges of the past by proving to ourselves and to the world around us that our rights and our values are the indispensable conditions of being an american   if we allow the threat of fear and terror t,0

madam speaker  i rise in support of the motion to instruct   this bill makes permanent the most dangerous and intrusive provisions of the patriot act  14 of the 16 previously sunsetted provisions   the remaining two sunsetting provisions are renewed for 10 years   ten years is not a sunset   ten years is quasipermanent   these provisions are particularly worrisome because they expand the powers of the police to pry into the privacy of ordinary americans  to go into their homes  into th,0
madam speaker  i want to make two points  one  the bad parts about section 215 and section 505 are not that  under certain circumstances  the fbi or other investigative agencies can get information from libraries   no one is proposing  as mr sensenbrenner  said  to say that libraries are totally sacrosanct   the bad part is that the fbi can get all this private personal information without any proper or adequate judicial review and then can tell them  shut up  do not tell the victim ,0
madam speaker  the crippling reach of methamphetamine abuse has become the nation s leading drug problem today  and this is according to a survey by 500 sheriffs departments in 45 states   it is cheap to buy   it is easy to make   it is available everywhere   it is highly addictive   oftentimes it is addictive after just one use   so it is currently replacing cocaine and heroin in many parts of the country   it leads to increased crime  child abuse  increases in the jail population ,1
mr speaker  i appreciate the leadership that we are getting on this   this is a very difficult time for me because i have been a republican all my life  and one of the things that i have fought for more than anything else is fairness   do i always agree with one side or the other   not always   my entire political career i have spent trying to just maintain balance   the interesting thing that was brought up earlier in the debate  as i watched it from my office on this rule  was that t,0

mr chairman  anyone who was serving in congress on september 11  2001  will never forget the day   we watched television in horror as the world trade center collapsed  and then were rushed out of the us capitol when flight 77 crashed into the pentagon   president bush immediately challenged us to provide us citizens with protections against the new threat of worldwide terrorism  and within weeks we responded with the usa patriot act   as chairman of the house financial services comm,1
madam speaker  i support our action today to reauthorize the usa patriot act   within weeks after the horrendous terrorist attacks of 2001  congress responded with the patriot act  providing our law enforcement and intelligence communities with muchneeded tools to track down terrorists  sever their communications and funding networks  and prevent future attacks on our citizens   as chairman of the house financial services committee  i was proud to help write the antiterrorist financing ,1

mr chairman  i rise in reluctant opposition to this bill   in 2001 after an attack on the united states and the slaughter of innocent civilians  this congress passed the patriot act  which i supported at that time   it gave our investigative agencies a wide variety of special powers to fight terrorism and to win this war on terrorism   however  these powers were not to be permanent   they were designed to help us win the war  not to change our country permanently   now we have the pat,0
i would suggest that we do not have to sunset all the legislation going through this congress  but we have to pay particular attention to that legislation that affects the civil liberties of our people   and if we are going to in some way expand the power of government over our people in time of war because it is necessary  that should be sunsetted once the war is over   by permanently changing america  we are not furthering the cause of freedom in this country   ,0
mr speaker  i rise in support of this motion   after 911  the united states congress gave our investigative agencies a wide variety of special powers to fight a war on terrorism  an expansion of powers that we would have never approved in peacetime   this included the right to break into homes of american citizens without court order  seize documents  copy computer files  and evidence without ever telling the owner   we gave our agencies  among those other things  the right to wiret,0

madam speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   madam speaker  i rise in strong support of this motion to instruct conferees on the patriot act   let me note that i am one of several  if not many  members of congress who feel that it was an act of bad faith on the part of those in this body who turned the temporary sunsetted provisions of the patriot act into permanent law for the united states of america   i supported the patriot act and would have again voted for the patriot ,0
madam speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   the discussion today is not whether or not the federal government after 911 should have had expanded police powers and investigative authority   that is not the issue   and i voted for that expansion of the police power  just as most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle did  almost all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle voted   that is not the question  because wh,0

mr chairman  we are all watching what is happening in london  and with that backdrop  we are discussing reauthorizing the patriot act today   we are all committed to finding and fighting terrorists   no one party  democrats or republicans  has exclusivity over this issue   we are all for stopping terrorists and protecting our citizens   while we are all committed to this fight  it is still our congressional duty to exercise our oversight responsibilities   we can do this effectively ,1
mr speaker  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to this conference report   all of us are in agreement that the united states government must do everything it can do to effectively fight terrorism and protect the american people from another terrorist attack   there is no debate about that   but some of us believe that with strong  welltrained and wellfunded law enforcement  we can in fact protect the american people without underminin,0
mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   mr chairman  we live in a democracy where we respect checks and balances   the patriot act is part of a pattern of lacking checks and balances   military tribunals  not part of the patriot act but part of a pattern of reduced checks and balances   military tribunals were presented with no public trials  no presumption of innocence  no guilt beyond a reasonable doubt   secret evidence could be used  no judicial review   ,0

mr chairman  i would say that it would have been extremely helpful if we could have considered that   we could have got the definition straight  and we could have considered it in a more deliberative process rather than trying to deal with it here on the floor where we have some constitutional questions such as the death penalty for conspiracy   ,0

madam speaker  i rise in support of the motion to instruct   the current house bill provisions for 10 year sunsets on the 215 and 206 roving wiretap powers is not much better than no sunset at all   what we are talking about under the 215 provision is power to get access to your personal records from a business  including a public library  without you ever knowing about it  or what is done with the information   and the librarian or other business operator can not tell you or anyone else ,0
mr chairman  i yield myself 1 minute   the gentleman from virginia  mr boucher   is sincere in his opposition to this bill  and i respect that   however  neither the national security letter scheme nor the delayed notification scheme were authorized for the first time by the patriot act   that was legislation that was in place prior to october 2001 when the original patriot act was passed and signed into law by the president   what the patriot act did in both national security letters,1

mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time   after listening to the speech of the distinguished minority leader  i have reached the conclusion she has not read the bill   she has not looked at the oversight that the committee on the judiciary has done over the last 3 12 years   we have an oversight record of bipartisan letters sent to the justice department  inspector general s reports  and hearings that have a stack of paper that is about 2 feet high   in this bill ,1
mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit   good oversight is done by congressional leadership  not by sunsets   there has been good oversight over the patriot act right from the beginning   the committee on the judiciary has spent a lot of time overseeing the justice department  with oversight letters  questions that the gentleman from michigan  mr conyers   and i have sent jointly to the justice department  inspector general reports  and this is the result of it ,1

madam speaker  i yield myself the balance of my time   madam speaker  the gentleman from michigan has said that he wants us to recede to the senate  and that means that the senate bill goes to the president as passed by that body   that means that there will be no provisions relative to control of methamphetamine   there will be no provisions relating to airline security or port security or mass transit security   the inspector general s audits that are contained in the conference report,1

mr chairman  section 215 of the patriot act pertains to the government s abilities to gain access to what we commonly refer to as business records  records compiled by a business or an institution pertaining to a customer or visitor to that entity   this provision has come to be known as the `` library provision  because many librarians and civil libertarians are concerned that this provision of the patriot act could authorize the government to pour through the library records of everyday,1

mr chairman  i too rise in support of this bill   we have had some great debate  11 hearings  and i appreciate my friend the gentleman from massachusetts  point about section 215  but the gentleman from florida  mr feeney   is right   i mean  library records are being used as a red herring   we have seen over and over that libraries have been used by terrorists and this will help address that   the thing is so far that provision of 215 has not been used with regard to libraries   ,1
mr chairman  i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin  mr sensenbrenner   for his leadership on this important legislation  and i rise today in support of this bill   i served in the justice department before and after 911   i led the department s counterterrorism efforts in the united states attorney s office in the state of texas   i worked with the joint terrorism task forces fighting this war on terror in the trenches   i know firsthand that this patriot act provides the nec,1
mr speaker  the patriot act was passed in october 2001 in response to the horrendous terrorist attacks on our country   its aim was to give the women and men of our law enforcement community the authority and tools needed to prevent future attacks and save and secure the lives of american citizens   there is no question  mr speaker  that many of the provisions of the patriot act have been useful to law enforcement and have helped to prevent terrorist attacks and secure our nation   but w,0
mr speaker  i rise today in support of the creation of a select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation for and response to hurricane katrina   as representatives  we are elected by the american people  and it is our duty to ensure that the numerous federal agencies of which we have oversight and that we fund on an annual basis serve the taxpayers efficiently and effectively  and i think from the images that we have seen and from the reports from that area of the country  we h,1
mr speaker  i rise in support of house resolution 439 and in support of the underlying resolution   mr speaker  the minority objects to house resolution 437 on the basis that the bipartisan committee it creates will be inherently unbalanced and unfair   one suspects they believe it will be unfair largely because while they will have full rights of representation on the committee in question  they will inevitably be the minority on any panel that fairly represents the composition of both t,1
mr speaker  i ask unanimous consent to temporarily control the time of the gentleman from california  mr dreier     ,1
mr speaker  i just want to make a couple of quick points  and then i will reserve the balance of my time   i would disagree very strongly with my good friend from florida about the 911 commission   there were  in fact  many investigations in this congress about the tragedy that took place on 911  the permanent select committee on intelligence amongst them   we did actually do oversight   ,1
reclaiming my time  mr speaker  and i respect the opinion of my good friend from florida  but i think there was oversight   but i would actually agree with his fundamental point in the sense that i think oversight is more effectively done by the elected representatives of the people  by the appropriate people who are responsible for implementing the solution   i do not think we should take that model and follow it again here   i also would suspect that the situation between a deliberate ,1

mr speaker  house resolution 439 is a closed rule providing for 1 hour of debate for consideration of h res 437  a resolution establishing a select bipartisan committee to investigate the preparation for and response to hurricane katrina   the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides one motion to recommit which may not contain instructions   mr speaker  the human suffering and physical damage wrought by hurricane katrina is heartwrenching and over,1

mr speaker  i rise in opposition to the rule and to the underlying resolution   the federal response to hurricane katrina was absolutely unacceptable   the american people deserve to know what went so terribly wrong and what we must do to make sure it never  ever happens again   unfortunately  the partisan committee being proposed by the republican majority will not give the american people any confidence that congress is asking tough questions and demanding straight answers   apparently,0
mr speaker  for so many reasons my colleagues on this side of the aisle have articulated  this resolution should be rejected   because it is neither bipartisan in terms of its authority  nor bipartisan in terms of its power  nor bipartisan in terms of its subpoena power   that will all rest with the majority   the question that must be answered is how is it that fema  which 5 years ago was a worldclass agency that was being praised by republicans and democrats alike  by local official,0
mr speaker  i thank the ranking member  the gentlewoman from new york  ms slaughter    for yielding me this time and commend the members of the committee on rules for their important work on this subject  particularly the gentleman from florida  mr hastings   who is the author of the legislation  along with the gentleman from new jersey  mr menendez    the chairman of our caucus  on legislation which will bring truth to this situation  an independent commission  modeled after ,0
mr speaker  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr speaker  on tuesday  president bush said that he took responsibility for the recent failure of the federal government to fulfill its ultimate duty of saving the lives of its own people within its own borders   but what does responsibility mean   if it means anything  it means the sincere concern for what has happened under his watch   it means stopping at nothing to find out why a nation led by officials who claim to care about,0

mr chairman  i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks   mr chairman  the endangered species act is a wellintentioned law that has failed in its implementation   originally billed as a way to recover and rehabilitate endangered species  it has failed at that goal   as it has been pointed out  less than 1 percent of species listed have recovered in the entire history of the act   almost 3 times that many still listed are believed to already be extinct   many species that,1
mr chairman  i rise in support of hr 3824  the threatened and endangered species recovery act   i commend the gentleman from california  chairman pombo  and the gentleman from california  mr cardoza   for this legislation   this legislation modernizes the endangered species act  or esa  to allow for more scientific review  better conservation plans  and to focus on a recovery process that is based on collaboration and not conflict   after more than 3 decades  the esa has failed,1
mr speaker  i am pleased that both sides of the aisle have recognized the need of some modifications in the endangered species act   i would like to  mr speaker  introduce you to a man by the name of john gochnauer   john gochnauer was the shortstop for the cleveland indians in 1902 and 1903   in 1902  playing fulltime at shortstop for the indians  he hit a paltry 185 and committed a whopping 48 errors in that position   nonetheless  he came back the next year to play for them in 1,1
mr chairman  i appreciate the opportunity to stand here and speak about this particular substitute   as it was brought to the committee on rules last night  i noticed that it has been consistently called the `` bipartisan substitute  it does have eight cosponsors that are bipartisan   but i would note that the actual bill itself has 95 cosponsors and it has four times as many democrats on the bill itself as the socalled `` bipartisan substitute  so i would like to speak a bit about ,1
mr chairman  i rise in support of this bipartisan substitute and in unwavering opposition to the underlying threatened and endangered species act of 2005  which does not defend endangered species as it purports  but rather protects the special interests of private industry and landowners   i am concerned about the environmental and fiscal health of our great nation and the path chosen by many of america s leaders whose policies are painfully lacking in promoting conservation   although am,0
mr speaker  i rise in strong opposition to both the rule and the bill   no matter how the proponents of the bill classify putting soft words and talking about it being reasonable or a compromise  it does not make it so   this is less about reform of the esa and protecting species  and more about making it easier for the exploitation of the environment   we have been in a state of stalemate for a number of years because the goal has not been reasonable refinement   there are things we cou,0
mr chairman  i would just like to correct a couple of things   first of all  this is mandatory spending we are talking about   secondly  we do not allow the taxpayer protection in this bill that is allowed in highway cases   that is important to distinguish between the two   mr chairman  we are all in agreement   there is broad and justifiable consensus that the act is overdue for reform  but reforming the law should not be a euphemism for gutting the law  and that is exactly what t,0

mr chairman  reforming the endangered species act is long overdue   today the house has an opportunity to enact significant improvements to esa that restore balance and protections to species as well as landowners   one of the most effective ways to protect species habitat is through development of habitat conservation plans   the bill improves and encourages habitat conservation plans by codifying the nosurprise policy and eliminating unnecessary red tape that required multiple consultati,1

mr chairman  i yield myself such time as i may consume   mr chairman  when the endangered species act was adopted by congress in 1973  it was heralded as landmark use of environmental legislation for the protection and conservation of threatened and endangered species   at that time  it was clearly understood that the ultimate goal of the act was to focus federal resources on listed species so that  in time  they could be returned to a healthy state and be removed from the list   i fu,1

mr chairman  i rise today in opposition to the substitute being offered for a number of reasons   the substitute basically takes the pombo bill and cuts out everything that is important to my constituents  the small farmers and ranchers of the central valley who are being driven out of our valley through arbitrary and capricious regulatory burdens   it is my constituents who are the ones that are begging me to help them reform the endangered species act  and i think this substitute leaves ,1

mr chairman  reclaiming my time  i thank the chairman for his answer   that was the way that i read the bill too  and i wanted the congressional intent to be on the record   ,1
mr chairman  the substitute would be a great improvement for the current endangered species act   it would treat landowners much as we do under the conservation reserve program  but the underlying bill would be a disaster for taxpayers  a new entitlement   the secretary shall pay no less than fair market value   i guess the secretary  if they are feeling good that day  could pay more than fair market value with taxpayers  money  borrowed money  and it does not require the historic  ,0
mr chairman  i rise in strong opposition to this bill   the legislation before us today turns back the clock on 35 years of progress in responsible environmental stewardship by gutting the current endangered species act and replacing it with little to preserve endangered wildlife for future generations   over 99 percent of the species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under current law have been saved from extinction   but had this bill been the law of the land over the last,0

first let me say to the gentleman that i am very appreciative of his efforts here to make the esa a better law   mr chairman  it is my understanding that the legislation would provide the president the authority to waive or expedite any provision of the act in the event of a major national disaster   i also understand that the legislation would require the secretary to develop regulations establishing procedures for an expedited application or waiver of the act for agency actions that would ,1

mr chairman  i thank the gentleman for yielding me time   the time is insufficient  not only to explain my position  but also the time for consideration of this bill has been insufficient   thirtytwo years ago  we passed a bill that a republican president  richard nixon  signed to protect and conserve species in danger of extinction   unfortunately  though  the underlying bill  which has been fasttracked since its introduction  would substantially undermine the endangered species,0

mr chairman  what possible reason is there for taxpayers to have to pay three  four times for the same protection of endangered species   under the bill as written  the taxpayer would have to pay a landowner once for the privileges of not building the casino   that landowner could then sell it to his brother   the taxpayer has to pay his brother a second time for the same project   his brother could sell it to his cousin  and the taxpayer would have to pay a third time for the same casi,0

mr chairman  i appreciate the approach that the committee is taking in trying to revamp and revise the endangered species act   this has been a vitally important and successful act throughout recent decades   and while there is wide agreement here on the house floor that it should be amended and tweaked and improved on in light of past experience and modern times  we need to do it responsibly  and i believe that responsible approach is better reflected in the substitute that is being offer,0
mr chairman  the endangered species act remains an enduring testament to the importance the american people place on preserving plant and animal species for future generations   that sentiment was reflected in president richard nixon s words during his signing of the act on december 28  1973 when he said  `` nothing is more priceless and more worthy of preservation than the rich array of animal life with which our country has been blessed   it is a manyfaceted treasure  of value to scho,0

mr chairman  reclaiming my time  this provision was not in the contract with america   nobody seems to be constrained by the truth here   this is a brandnew way of dealing with compensating property owners whose land is taken   cbo scored this at  10 million   this is a brandnew way of dealing with a very real problem and assuring some kind of protection to my property owners and your property owners   mr chairman  it was just a couple of weeks ago that the supreme court came out wi,1

mr chairman  i yield myself 30 seconds to say  this is another area where you guys are just not consistent   one of you comes down and beats us up because we are spending too much money about this massive increase in spending under this bill   somebody else comes down and says  you do not fully fund endangered species under this bill   either we spend too much or we do not spend enough   you can not have it both ways   either we spend too much or we do not spend enough  but you can not,1

mr chairman  i want to thank the gentleman from california for keeping this issue on the front burner   i have come to learn in my time in congress that people support reform  as long as it does not change anything  and that is what we find with the endangered species reform   i thought i was given a great honor when i first got here in the year 2001   the gentleman from alaska  mr young   of the committee on resources put me on the study group to talk about the endangered species act ,1
mr chairman  i rise in support of hr 3824   reform of the endangered species act is much needed   the law has adversely affected thousands of farmers  ranchers and homeowners whose private property has been taken without compensation   over 90 percent of endangered plant and animal species are found on private property   there should be a balance between the rights of property owners and conservation   hr 3824 will allow the secretary of interior to compensate private property owners,1
mr chairman  i rise today in opposition to hr 3824  the threatened and endangered species recovery act   the republican majority has already dismantled nearly every government program for people  and now it appears they re moving on to other species   they constantly preach that god s creations are precious  yet once again they are showing their hypocrisy that they would be so careless with the lives of god s creatures   perhaps if some of these endangered species were in a persiste,0
mr chairman  i thank my good friend from california  mr george miller   for yielding me the time  and i join him in offering this substitute  because the bill we are considering today  hr 3824  will make it less likely that threatened and endangered species will recover  but today we can support this bipartisan substitute which will update and improve the endangered species act   i reject the notion  mr chairman  that we can not preserve both our natural environment for future ge,0

mr speaker  this bill represents a new low   wasteful drilling in the arctic and dismantling the clean air act are bad enough  but now the republican majority wants to weaken the endangered species act  weaken it by handing out subsidies to oil and gas companies and land speculators for not killing endangered species  meaning taxpayers will be giving money to these land developers for simply following the law or for taking a risk by making a big investment in land so they can sell it at a ,0

mr speaker  i yield myself 10 minutes   mr speaker  i will not take very long on this bill either  but i do think it is important to take note of a few facts   at the beginning of this year  it was made quite clear by the majority that they desired to finish all appropriations bills on time and that there be no omnibus appropriations bill lumping all kinds of disassociated items into the same package   we on the minority side of the aisle have provided procedural cooperation at virtuall,1

just briefly  i respect the gentleman s observation that the majority party in the senate is the party that i share  the republican party  but i learned a long time ago to stop trying to answer for that chamber over there   that is a tough body to figure out   the gentleman knows as well as i do that they tend to bog down in the oratory and slow down on the action   ,1
